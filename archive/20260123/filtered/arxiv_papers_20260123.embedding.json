      "abstract": "Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

      "abstract": "Robot foundation models are beginning to deliver on the promise of generalist robotic agents, yet progress remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale real-world manipulation datasets. Simulation and synthetic data generation offer a scalable alternative, but their usefulness is limited by the visual domain gap between simulation and reality. In this work, we present Point Bridge, a framework that leverages unified, domain-agnostic point-based representations to unlock synthetic datasets for zero-shot sim-to-real policy transfer, without explicit visual or object-level alignment. Point Bridge combines automated point-based representation extraction via Vision-Language Models (VLMs), transformer-based policy learning, and efficient inference-time pipelines to train capable real-world manipulation agents using only synthetic data. With additional co-training on small sets of real demonstrations, Point Bridge further improves performance, substantially outperforming prior vision-based sim-and-real co-training methods. It achieves up to 44% gains in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and up to 66% with limited real data across both single-task and multitask settings.

We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.",

      "abstract": "Representation Autoencoders (RAEs) have shown distinct advantages in diffusion modeling on ImageNet by training in high-dimensional semantic latent spaces. In this work, we investigate whether this framework can scale to large-scale, freeform text-to-image (T2I) generation. We first scale RAE decoders on the frozen representation encoder (SigLIP-2) beyond ImageNet by training on web, synthetic, and text-rendering data, finding that while scale improves general fidelity, targeted data composition is essential for specific domains like text. We then rigorously stress-test the RAE design choices originally proposed for ImageNet. Our analysis reveals that scaling simplifies the framework: while dimension-dependent noise scheduling remains critical, architectural complexities such as wide diffusion heads and noise-augmented decoding offer negligible benefits at scale Building on this simplified framework, we conduct a controlled comparison of RAE against the state-of-the-art FLUX VAE across diffusion transformer scales from 0.5B to 9.8B parameters. RAEs consistently outperform VAEs during pretraining across all model scales. Further, during finetuning on high-quality datasets, VAE-based models catastrophically overfit after 64 epochs, while RAE models remain stable through 256 epochs and achieve consistently better performance. Across all experiments, RAE-based diffusion models demonstrate faster convergence and better generation quality, establishing RAEs as a simpler and stronger foundation than VAEs for large-scale T2I generation. Additionally, because both visual understanding and generation can operate in a shared representation space, the multimodal model can directly reason over generated latents, opening new possibilities for unified models.",

      "abstract": "Many Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models flatten image patches into a 1D token sequence, weakening the 2D spatial cues needed for precise manipulation. We introduce IVRA, a lightweight, training-free method that improves spatial understanding by exploiting affinity hints already available in the model's built-in vision encoder, without requiring any external encoder or retraining. IVRA selectively injects these affinity signals into a language-model layer in which instance-level features reside. This inference-time intervention realigns visual-token interactions and better preserves geometric structure while keeping all model parameters fixed. We demonstrate the generality of IVRA by applying it to diverse VLA architectures (LLaRA, OpenVLA, and FLOWER) across simulated benchmarks spanning both 2D and 3D manipulation (VIMA and LIBERO) and on various real-robot tasks. On 2D VIMA, IVRA improves average success by +4.2% over the baseline LLaRA in a low-data regime. On 3D LIBERO, it yields consistent gains over the OpenVLA and FLOWER baselines, including improvements when baseline accuracy is near saturation (96.3% to 97.1%).

We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverage the file system to handle long contexts, and execute scripts to satisfy formatting requirements. We further show that these agentic capabilities can be enhanced through LLM-in-Sandbox Reinforcement Learning (LLM-in-Sandbox-RL), which uses only non-agentic data to train models for sandbox exploration. Experiments demonstrate that LLM-in-Sandbox, in both training-free and post-trained settings, achieves robust generalization spanning mathematics, physics, chemistry, biomedicine, long-context understanding, and instruction following. Finally, we analyze LLM-in-Sandbox's efficiency from computational and system perspectives, and open-source it as a Python package to facilitate real-world deployment.",

      "abstract": "We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.",

      "abstract": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong capabilities across diverse applications, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that distort their feature representations and induce erroneous predictions. To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs. Specifically, FS transforms any feature encoder into a smoothed variant that is guaranteed to maintain a certified lower bound on the feature cosine similarity between clean and adversarial representations under $\\ell_2$-bounded attacks. Moreover, we indicate that the value of this Feature Cosine Similarity Bound (FCSB) derived from FS can be improved by enlarging the defined Gaussian robustness score on the vanilla encoder. Building upon this, we introduce the Purifier and Smoothness Mapper (PSM), a plug-and-play module that improves the Gaussian robustness score of MLLMs and thus enhances their certified robustness under FS, without requiring any retraining on MLLMs. We demonstrate that the FS with PSM not only provides a strong theoretical robustness guarantee but also exhibits superior empirical performance compared to adversarial training. Extensive experiments across diverse MLLMs and downstream tasks indicate the effectiveness of the FS-PSM, reducing the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of various white-box attacks from nearly 90\\% to about 1\\%.",

      "abstract": "This paper investigates the multi-compartment vehicle routing problem with multiple time windows (MCVRPMTW), an extension of the classical vehicle routing problem with time windows that considers vehicles equipped with multiple compartments and customers requiring service across several delivery time windows. The problem incorporates three key compartment-related features: (i) compartment flexibility in the number of compartments, (ii) item-to-compartment compatibility, and (iii) item-to-item compatibility. The problem also accommodates practical operational requirements such as driver breaks. To solve the MCVRPMTW, we develop an exact branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm in which the pricing problem is solved using a labeling algorithm. Several acceleration strategies are introduced to limit symmetry during label extensions, improve the stability of dual solutions in column generation, and enhance the branching process. To handle large-scale instances, we propose a rolling-space B&P algorithm that integrates clustering techniques into the solution framework. Extensive computational experiments on instances inspired by a real-world industrial application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provide useful managerial insights for practical implementation.",

      "abstract": "Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

      "abstract": "How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.",

      "abstract": "Uncertainty estimation in machine learning has traditionally focused on the prediction stage, aiming to quantify confidence in model outputs while treating learned representations as deterministic and reliable by default. In this work, we challenge this implicit assumption and argue that reliability should be regarded as a first-class property of learned representations themselves. We propose a principled framework for reliable representation learning that explicitly models representation-level uncertainty and leverages structural constraints as inductive biases to regularize the space of feasible representations. Our approach introduces uncertainty-aware regularization directly in the representation space, encouraging representations that are not only predictive but also stable, well-calibrated, and robust to noise and structural perturbations. Structural constraints, such as sparsity, relational structure, or feature-group dependencies, are incorporated to define meaningful geometry and reduce spurious variability in learned representations, without assuming fully correct or noise-free structure. Importantly, the proposed framework is independent of specific model architectures and can be integrated with a wide range of representation learning methods.",

We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.",

      "abstract": "Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Policy, a simple approach for adapting a large pretrained video model (Cosmos-Predict2) into an effective robot policy through a single stage of post-training on the robot demonstration data collected on the target platform, with no architectural modifications. Cosmos Policy learns to directly generate robot actions encoded as latent frames within the video model's latent diffusion process, harnessing the model's pretrained priors and core learning algorithm to capture complex action distributions. Additionally, Cosmos Policy generates future state images and values (expected cumulative rewards), which are similarly encoded as latent frames, enabling test-time planning of action trajectories with higher likelihood of success. In our evaluations, Cosmos Policy achieves state-of-the-art performance on the LIBERO and RoboCasa simulation benchmarks (98.5% and 67.1% average success rates, respectively) and the highest average score in challenging real-world bimanual manipulation tasks, outperforming strong diffusion policies trained from scratch, video model-based policies, and state-of-the-art vision-language-action models fine-tuned on the same robot demonstrations. Furthermore, given policy rollout data, Cosmos Policy can learn from experience to refine its world model and value function and leverage model-based planning to achieve even higher success rates in challenging tasks.

To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for continual learning designed to adapt to new domains while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed pipeline integrates a dual-input Convolutional Neural Network, utilizing both Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) and Mel-spectrogram features, supported by a multi-stage denoising process, involving discrete wavelet transform and spectral subtraction techniques, plus model and prototype update blocks. Unlike prior methods that restrict updates to specific layers, our approach updates the complete quantized model, made possible due to compact model architecture. A subset of input samples are selected during runtime using class prototypes and confidence-driven filtering, which are then pseudo-labeled and combined with rehearsal buffer for incremental model retraining. Experimental results on noisy test dataset demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, achieving 99.63\\% accuracy on clean data and maintaining robust performance (exceeding 94\\% accuracy) across diverse noisy environments, even at -10 dB Signal-to-Noise Ratio. The proposed framework work confirms that integrating efficient denoising with prototype-based continual learning enables KWS models to operate autonomously and robustly in resource-constrained, dynamic environments.",

Our framework establishes a coarse-to-fine alignment mechanism comprising two key components: the Frame Features Selection Module (FFSM) and the Patch Features Compression Module (PFCM). FFSM mimics the human macro-perception ability by selecting key frames to eliminate temporal redundancy. Subsequently, PFCM simulates micro-perception by aggregating patch features into salient visual entities through an advanced attention mechanism, enabling precise entity-level matching. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that HVD not only captures human-like visual focus but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

We focus on the situation in which the functions of interest are not known precisely but can only be approximated. As a first contribution we generalize an iteration scheme called dampened Mann iteration, recently introduced in the literature. The improved scheme relaxes previous constraints on parameter sequences, allowing learning rates to converge to zero or not converge at all. While seemingly minor, this flexibility is essential to enable the implementation of chaotic iterations, where only a subset of components is updated in each step, allowing to tackle higher-dimensional problems. Additionally, by allowing learning rates to converge to zero, we can relax conditions on the convergence speed of function approximations, making the method more adaptable to various scenarios. We also show that dampened Mann iteration applies immediately to compute the expected payoff in various probabilistic models, including simple stochastic games, not covered by previous work.",

Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.",

      "abstract": "The Arabic language has undergone notable transformations over time, including the emergence of new vocabulary, the obsolescence of others, and shifts in word usage. This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic classification of Arabic texts by time period, particularly beyond the domain of poetry. This paper addresses this gap by employing neural networks and deep learning techniques to automatically classify Arabic texts into distinct eras and periods. The proposed models are evaluated using two datasets derived from two publicly available corpora, covering texts from the pre-Islamic to the modern era. The study examines class setups ranging from binary to 15-class classification and considers both predefined historical eras and custom periodizations. Results range from F1-scores of 0.83 and 0.79 on the binary-era classification task using the OpenITI and APCD datasets, respectively, to 0.20 on the 15-era classification task using OpenITI and 0.18 on the 12-era classification task using APCD.",

This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.",

Recent research on merging multilingual multitask models has shown promise in terms of improved quality, but its computational and maintenance efficiency remains unstudied. In this work, we provide the first focused analysis of this merging strategy from an efficiency perspective, evaluating it across three independent tasks. We demonstrate significant efficiency gains while maintaining parity in terms of quality: this merging approach reduces the initial training time by up to 50\\%. We also demonstrate that updating an individual language and re-merging as part of model maintenance reduces training costs by more than 60\\%, compared to re-training the full multilingual model. We show this on both public and proprietary industry datasets confirming that the approach works well for industrial use cases in addition to academic settings already studied in previous work.",

Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.",

      "abstract": "Imbalanced classification, where one class is observed far less frequently than the other, often causes standard training procedures to prioritize the majority class and perform poorly on rare but important cases. A classic and widely used remedy is to augment the minority class with synthetic examples, but two basic questions remain under-resolved: when does synthetic augmentation actually help, and how many synthetic samples should be generated?   We develop a unified statistical framework for synthetic augmentation in imbalanced learning, studying models trained on imbalanced data augmented with synthetic minority samples and evaluated under the balanced population risk. Our theory shows that synthetic data is not always beneficial. In a ``local symmetry\" regime, imbalance is not the dominant source of error near the balanced optimum, so adding synthetic samples cannot improve learning rates and can even degrade performance by amplifying generator mismatch. When augmentation can help (a ``local asymmetry\" regime), the optimal synthetic size depends on generator accuracy and on whether the generator's residual mismatch is directionally aligned with the intrinsic majority-minority shift. This structure can make the best synthetic size deviate from naive full balancing, sometimes by a small refinement and sometimes substantially when generator bias is systematic. Practically, we recommend Validation-Tuned Synthetic Size (VTSS): select the synthetic size by minimizing balanced validation loss over a range centered near the fully balanced baseline, while allowing meaningful departures when the data indicate them. Simulations and a real sepsis prediction study support the theory and illustrate when synthetic augmentation helps, when it cannot, and how to tune its quantity effectively.",

      "abstract": "Executing Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) on neuromorphic hardware poses the problem of mapping neurons to cores. SNNs operate by propagating spikes between neurons that form a graph through synapses. Neuromorphic hardware mimics them through a network-on-chip, transmitting spikes, and a mesh of cores, each managing several neurons. Its operational cost is tied to spike movement and active cores. A mapping comprises two tasks: partitioning the SNN's graph to fit inside cores and placement of each partition on the hardware mesh. Both are NP-hard problems, and as SNNs and hardware scale towards billions of neurons, they become increasingly difficult to tackle effectively. In this work, we propose to raise the abstraction of SNNs from graphs to hypergraphs, redesigning mapping techniques accordingly. The resulting model faithfully captures the replication of spikes inside cores by exposing the notion of hyperedge co-membership between neurons. We further show that the overlap and locality of hyperedges strongly correlate with high-quality mappings, making these properties instrumental in devising mapping algorithms. By exploiting them directly, grouping neurons through shared hyperedges, communication traffic and hardware resource usage can be reduced be yond what just contracting individual connections attains. To substantiate this insight, we consider several partitioning and placement algorithms, some newly devised, others adapted from literature, and compare them over progressively larger and bio-plausible SNNs. Our results show that hypergraph based techniques can achieve better mappings than the state-of-the-art at several execution time regimes. Based on these observations, we identify a promising selection of algorithms to achieve effective mappings at any scale.",

To this end, we propose a distillation-based layer dropping (DLD) framework that effectively combines the capabilities of knowledge distillation and $\\mathcal{LD}$ in an end-to-end fashion, thereby achieving state-of-the-art performance for dynamic speech networks. Comprehensive experimentation utilizing well-known speech recognition methods, including conformer and WavLM, on three public benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework, reducing the word error rate by $9.32\\%$ and $2.25\\%$ for high and no dropping cases with $33.3\\%$ reduction in training time.",

      "abstract": "Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for low-resource languages remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of large-scale annotated training datasets. Languages such as Kashmiri, with approximately 7 million speakers and a complex Perso-Arabic script featuring unique diacritical marks, currently lack support in major OCR systems including Tesseract, TrOCR, and PaddleOCR. Manual dataset creation for such languages is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone, often requiring word by word transcription of printed or handwritten text.   We present SynthOCR-Gen, an open-source synthetic OCR dataset generator specifically designed for low-resource languages. Our tool addresses the fundamental bottleneck in OCR development by transforming digital Unicode text corpora into ready-to-use training datasets. The system implements a comprehensive pipeline encompassing text segmentation (character, word, n-gram, sentence, and line levels), Unicode normalization with script purity enforcement, multi-font rendering with configurable distribution, and 25+ data augmentation techniques simulating real-world document degradations including rotation, blur, noise, and scanner artifacts.   We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by generating a 600,000-sample word-segmented Kashmiri OCR dataset, which we release publicly on HuggingFace. This work provides a practical pathway for bringing low-resource languages into the era of vision-language AI models, and the tool is openly available for researchers and practitioners working with underserved writing systems worldwide.",

Unlike previous applications of BCT models, the tree structure in our model represents interval partitioning on the time domain. Moreover, interval partitioning is represented by recursive logistic regression models. By adjusting logistic regression coefficients, our model can represent split positions at arbitrary locations within each interval. This enables more compact tree representations. For simultaneous estimation of both split positions and tree depth, we develop an effective inference algorithm that combines local variational approximation for logistic regression with the context tree weighting (CTW) algorithm.

      "abstract": "We propose a control framework that integrates model-based bipedal locomotion with residual reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve robust and adaptive walking in the presence of real-world uncertainties. Our approach leverages a model-based controller, comprising a Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) trajectory planner and a whole-body controller, as a reliable base policy. To address the uncertainties of inaccurate dynamics modeling and sensor noise, we introduce a residual policy trained through RL with domain randomization. Crucially, we employ a model-based oracle policy, which has privileged access to ground-truth dynamics during training, to supervise the residual policy via a novel supervised loss. This supervision enables the policy to efficiently learn corrective behaviors that compensate for unmodeled effects without extensive reward shaping. Our method demonstrates improved robustness and generalization across a range of randomized conditions, offering a scalable solution for sim-to-real transfer in bipedal locomotion.",

To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first systematic benchmarks comparing three or more published Raman-specific deep learning classifiers across multiple open-source Raman datasets. We evaluate five representative deep learning architectures under a unified training and hyperparameter tuning protocol across three open-source Raman datasets selected to support standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and explicit distribution-shift testing. We report classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores to provide a fair and reproducible comparison of deep learning models for Raman spectra based classification.",

This work investigates a scalable multilingual Text2Cypher, aiming to support new languages without re-running full fine-tuning, avoiding manual hyper-parameter tuning, and maintaining performance close to joint multilingual fine-tuning. We train language-specific LoRA adapters for English, Spanish, and Turkish and combined them via uniform linear merging or learned fusion MLP with dynamic gating. Experimental results show that the fusion MLP recovers around 75\\% of the accuracy gains from joint multilingual fine-tuning while requiring only a smaller subset of the data, outperforming linear merging across all three languages. This approach enables incremental language expansion to new languages by requiring only one LoRA adapter and a lightweight MLP retraining.

Unlike classical Eulerian NCA where cells are pinned to pixels or voxels, NPA model each cell as a particle with a continuous position and internal state, both updated by a shared, learnable neural rule. This particle-based formulation yields clear individuation of cells, allows heterogeneous dynamics, and concentrates computation only on regions where activity is present. At the same time, particle systems pose challenges: neighborhoods are dynamic, and a naive implementation of local interactions scale quadratically with the number of particles. We address these challenges by replacing grid-based neighborhood perception with differentiable Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) operators backed by memory-efficient, CUDA-accelerated kernels, enabling scalable end-to-end training. Across tasks including morphogenesis, point-cloud classification, and particle-based texture synthesis, we show that NPA retain key NCA behaviors such as robustness and self-regeneration, while enabling new behaviors specific to particle systems. Together, these results position NPA as a compact neural model for learning self-organizing particle dynamics.",

However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.",

      "abstract": "Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.",

To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.",

A crucial new ingredient enabling our approach is a novel decomposition of any $s$-term DNF formula into ``local clusters'' of terms.

However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.",

We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\\left(T^{\\max\\{β,1-β\\}}\\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\\left(T^{1-β}\\right)$ for any $β\\in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty. In the strongly convex case, the regret is upper bounded by $O( \\log T )$ and the cumulative squared penalty is also upper bounded by $O( \\log T )$.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) typically involve a large number of parameters and are trained to achieve zero or near-zero training error. Despite such interpolation, they often exhibit strong generalization performance on unseen data, a phenomenon that has motivated extensive theoretical investigations. Comforting results show that interpolation indeed may not affect the minimax rate of convergence under the squared error loss. In the mean time, DNNs are well known to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations in future inputs. A natural question then arises: Can interpolation also escape from suboptimal performance under a future $X$-attack? In this paper, we investigate the adversarial robustness of interpolating estimators in a framework of nonparametric regression. A finding is that interpolating estimators must be suboptimal even under a subtle future $X$-attack, and achieving perfect fitting can substantially damage their robustness. An interesting phenomenon in the high interpolation regime, which we term the curse of simple size, is also revealed and discussed. Numerical experiments support our theoretical findings.",

      "abstract": "Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

      "abstract": "Deep learning has substantially advanced medical image segmentation, yet achieving robust generalization across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical structures remains a major challenge. A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization.",

      "abstract": "Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.",

      "abstract": "Accurate prediction of crop above-ground biomass (AGB) under water stress is critical for monitoring crop productivity, guiding irrigation, and supporting climate-resilient agriculture. Data-driven models scale well but often lack interpretability and degrade under distribution shift, whereas process-based crop models (e.g. DSSAT, APSIM, LINTUL5) require extensive calibration and are difficult to deploy over large spatial domains. To address these limitations, we propose AgriPINN, a process-informed neural network that integrates a biophysical crop-growth differential equation as a differentiable constraint within a deep learning backbone. This design encourages physiologically consistent biomass dynamics under water-stress conditions while preserving model scalability for spatially distributed AGB prediction. AgriPINN recovers latent physiological variables, including leaf area index (LAI), absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), and water-stress factors, without requiring direct supervision. We pretrain AgriPINN on 60 years of historical data across 397 regions in Germany and fine-tune it on three years of field experiments under controlled water treatments. Results show that AgriPINN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep-learning baselines (ConvLSTM-ViT, SLTF, CNN-Transformer) and the process-based LINTUL5 model in terms of accuracy (RMSE reductions up to $43\\%$) and computational efficiency. By combining the scalability of deep learning with the biophysical rigor of process-based modeling, AgriPINN provides a robust and interpretable framework for spatio-temporal AGB prediction, offering practical value for planning of irrigation infrastructure, yield forecasting, and climate-adaptation planning.",

To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best.

      "abstract": "We study the problem of collision-free humanoid traversal in cluttered indoor scenes, such as hurdling over objects scattered on the floor, crouching under low-hanging obstacles, or squeezing through narrow passages. To achieve this goal, the humanoid needs to map its perception of surrounding obstacles with diverse spatial layouts and geometries to the corresponding traversal skills. However, the lack of an effective representation that captures humanoid-obstacle relationships during collision avoidance makes directly learning such mappings difficult. We therefore propose Humanoid Potential Field (HumanoidPF), which encodes these relationships as collision-free motion directions, significantly facilitating RL-based traversal skill learning. We also find that HumanoidPF exhibits a surprisingly negligible sim-to-real gap as a perceptual representation. To further enable generalizable traversal skills through diverse and challenging cluttered indoor scenes, we further propose a hybrid scene generation method, incorporating crops of realistic 3D indoor scenes and procedurally synthesized obstacles. We successfully transfer our policy to the real world and develop a teleoperation system where users could command the humanoid to traverse in cluttered indoor scenes with just a single click. Extensive experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world to validate the effectiveness of our method. Demos and code can be found in our website: https://axian12138.github.io/CAT/.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing flexibilization of processes, determining robust scheduling decisions has become an important goal. Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.",

In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR.

      "abstract": "Functional dependencies (FDs) are fundamental integrity constraints in relational databases, but discovering them under incremental updates remains challenging. While static algorithms are inefficient due to full re-execution, incremental algorithms suffer from severe performance and memory bottlenecks. To address these challenges, this paper proposes EAIFD, a novel algorithm for incremental FD discovery. EAIFD maintains the partial hypergraph of difference sets and reframes the incremental FD discovery problem into minimal hitting set enumeration on hypergraph, avoiding full re-runs. EAIFD introduces two key innovations. First, a multi-attribute hash table ($MHT$) is devised for high-frequency key-value mappings of valid FDs, whose memory consumption is proven to be independent of the dataset size. Second, two-step validation strategy is developed to efficiently validate the enumerated candidates, which leverages $MHT$ to effectively reduce the validation space and then selectively loads data blocks for batch validation of remaining candidates, effectively avoiding repeated I/O operations. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate the significant advantages of EAIFD. Compared to existing algorithms, EAIFD achieves up to an order-of-magnitude speedup in runtime while reducing memory usage by over two orders-of-magnitude, establishing it as a highly efficient and scalable solution for incremental FD discovery.",

However, existing direct S2ST systems continue to face notable challenges, including instability in semantic-acoustic alignment when parallel speech data is scarce, difficulty in preserving speaker identity, and limited multilingual scalability. In this work, we introduce DS2ST-LM, a scalable, single-stage direct S2ST framework leveraging a multilingual Large Language Model (LLM). The architecture integrates a Whisper speech encoder, a learnable projection module, a Qwen2-0.5B LLM, and a timbre-controlled vocoder. We construct GigaS2S-1000, a 1000-hour bilingual corpus by extending the GigaST dataset with high-fidelity synthetic target speech, and show that this synthetic data alleviates data scarcity to some extent. We investigate two semantic token generation strategies: speech-derived S3 tokens and text-derived tokens generated by a pre-trained LLM, and analyze their impact on training stability and semantic consistency. We further evaluate three projection architectures (Linear, Conv1D-Linear, and Q-Former) and observe that while higher-capacity projectors converge faster, the simple Linear projector achieves higher performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DS2ST-LM outperforms traditional cascaded and ST (Qwen-Audio) + TTS baselines across both lexical (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic (BLEURT, COMET) metrics, while extending to multiple language pairs, including French, Spanish, German, Hindi, Bengali, and Urdu. Furthermore, we incorporate timbre-aware speech synthesis to preserve speaker information, enabling DS2ST-LM to surpass prior direct S2ST systems in both speaker similarity and perceptual naturalness.",

However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents Mecellem models, a framework for developing specialized language models for the Turkish legal domain through domain adaptation strategies. We make two contributions: (1)Encoder Model Pre-trained from Scratch: ModernBERT-based bidirectional encoders pre-trained on a Turkish-dominant corpus of 112.7 billion tokens. We implement a checkpoint selection strategy that evaluates downstream retrieval performance throughout training, revealing that optimal checkpoints achieve best retrieval scores before pre-training loss reaches its minimum. Our encoder models achieve top-3 rankings on the Turkish retrieval leaderboard, with smaller models (155M parameters) achieving comparable performance to larger reference models (307M-567M parameters). Our approach achieves 92.36% production efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models (embeddinggemma-300m: 100.00%, BAAI/bge-m3: 99.54%, newmindai/bge-m3-stsb: 94.38%), ranking fourth overall despite requiring less computational resources. SOTA models rely on multi-stage, computationally intensive training pipelines, making our single-stage pre-training followed by efficient post-training approach a cost-effective alternative; (2)Decoder Model with Continual Pre-training (CPT): Qwen3-1.7B and Qwen3-4B models adapted to Turkish legal domain through controlled curriculum learning. Four-phase CPT with optimal sample ratios enables gradual transition from general language knowledge to specialized legal terminology and long-context reasoning. This approach achieves 36.2% perplexity reduction on Turkish legal text, demonstrating domain adaptation gains.",

      "abstract": "The representation of requirements plays a critical role in the accuracy of requirements inspection. While visual representations, such as UML diagrams, are widely used alongside text-based requirements, their effectiveness in supporting inspection is still debated. Cognitive abilities, such as working memory and mental rotation skills, may also influence inspection accuracy. This study aims to evaluate whether the use of UML sequence diagrams alongside text-based requirements improves the accuracy of requirements inspection compared to text-based requirements alone and to explore whether cognitive abilities are associated with differences in performance across the two treatments (text vs text with UML support). We conducted a crossover experiment with 38 participants to assess the accuracy of requirements inspection under the two treatments in terms of issues found and justifications provided. Linear mixed-effects and generalized linear models were used to analyse the effects of treatment, period, sequence, and cognitive abilities. The results indicate a significant three-way interaction between representation type, working memory capacity, and mental rotation ability. This finding suggests that the effectiveness of UML support is not uniform across individuals: participants with high scores in both cognitive abilities experienced reduced performance when using UML for violation detection. Conversely, the same cognitive profile was associated with improved justification accuracy under UML-aided inspection, indicating that higher cognitive abilities may support deeper reasoning processes when dealing with multi-modal information, i.e., diagrams and text.",

      "abstract": "Modern programming languages, most notably Rust, offer advanced linguistic constructs for building highly configurable software systems as aggregation of features -- identified by a configuration. However, they pose substantial challenges for program analysis, optimization, and testing, as the combinatorial explosion of configurations often makes exhaustive exploration infeasible. In this manuscript, we present the first compiler-based method for prioritizing configurations. Our approach consists of four main steps: 1. extracting a tailored intermediate representation from the Rust compiler, 2. constructing two complementary graph-based data structures, 3. using centrality measures to rank features, and 4. refining the ranking by considering the extent of code they impact. A fixed number of most relevant configurations are generated based on the achieved feature ranking. The validity of the generated configurations is guaranteed by using a SAT solver that takes a representation of this graph in conjunctive normal form. We formalized this approach and implemented it in a prototype, RustyEx, by instrumenting the Rust compiler. An empirical evaluation on higher-ranked open source Rust projects shows that RustyEx efficiently generates user-specified sets of configurations within bounded resources, while ensuring soundness by construction. The results demonstrate that centrality-guided configuration prioritization enables effective and practical exploration of large configuration spaces, paving the way for future research in configuration-aware analysis and optimization.",

To overcome these challenges, we present PUMA, an end-to-end learning framework that integrates visual perception and foothold priors into a single-stage training process. This approach leverages terrain features to estimate egocentric polar foothold priors, composed of relative distance and heading, guiding the robot in active posture adaptation for parkour tasks.

      "abstract": "With the increasing use of RDF graphs, storing and querying such data using SPARQL remains a critical problem. Current mainstream solutions rely on cloud-based data management architectures, but often suffer from performance bottle- necks in environments with limited bandwidth or high system load. To address this issue, this paper explores for the first time the integration of edge computing to move graph data storage and processing to edge environments, thereby improving query performance. This approach requires offloading query processing to edge servers, which involves addressing two challenges: data localization and network scheduling. First, the data localization challenge lies in computing the subgraphs maintained on edge servers to quickly identify the servers that can handle specific queries. To address this challenge, we introduce a new concept of pattern-induced subgraphs. Second, the network scheduling challenge involves efficiently assigning queries to edge and cloud servers to optimize overall system performance. We tackle this by constructing a overall system model that jointly captures data distribution, query characteristics, network communication, and computational resources. Accordingly, we further propose a joint formulation of query assignment and computational resource allocation, modeling it as a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem and solve this problem using a modified branch-and-bound algorithm. Experimental results on real datasets under a real cloud platform demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of efficiency.

Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $Θ(\\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound. Since the slack depends on $P_T$, an ensemble of learners with various slacks is used, yielding a method that is provably stable when it can be, and agile when it must be.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.",

Existing alignment methods present a difficult trade-off: fine-tuning approaches suffer from loss of diversity with reward over-optimization, while test-time scaling methods introduce significant computational overhead and tend to under-optimize. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, a novel framework that trains a hypernetwork for efficient and effective test-time alignment. Instead of modifying latent states, HyperAlign dynamically generates low-rank adaptation weights to modulate the diffusion model's generation operators. This allows the denoising trajectory to be adaptively adjusted based on input latents, timesteps and prompts for reward-conditioned alignment. We introduce multiple variants of HyperAlign that differ in how frequently the hypernetwork is applied, balancing between performance and efficiency. Furthermore, we optimize the hypernetwork using a reward score objective regularized with preference data to reduce reward hacking. We evaluate HyperAlign on multiple extended generative paradigms, including Stable Diffusion and FLUX. It significantly outperforms existing fine-tuning and test-time scaling baselines in enhancing semantic consistency and visual appeal.",

In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.",

While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.",

The reliance on \"Passive Observation\" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.",

      "abstract": "Model merging (MM) offers an efficient mechanism for integrating multiple specialized models without access to original training data or costly retraining. While MM has demonstrated success in domains like computer vision, its role in recommender systems (RSs) remains largely unexplored. Recently, Generative Recommendation (GR) has emerged as a new paradigm in RSs, characterized by rapidly growing model scales and substantial computational costs, making MM particularly appealing for cost-sensitive deployment scenarios. In this work, we present the first systematic study of MM in GR through a contextual lens. We focus on a fundamental yet underexplored challenge in real-world: how to merge generative recommenders specialized to different real-world contexts, arising from temporal evolving user behaviors and heterogeneous application domains. To this end, we propose a unified framework MMGRid, a structured contextual grid of GR checkpoints that organizes models trained under diverse contexts induced by temporal evolution and domain diversity. All checkpoints are derived from a shared base LLM but fine-tuned on context-specific data, forming a realistic and controlled model space for systematically analyzing MM across GR paradigms and merging algorithms. Our investigation reveals several key insights. First, training GR models from LLMs can introduce parameter conflicts during merging due to token distribution shifts and objective disparities; such conflicts can be alleviated by disentangling task-aware and context-specific parameter changes via base model replacement. Second, incremental training across contexts induces recency bias, which can be effectively balanced through weighted contextual merging. Notably, we observe that optimal merging weights correlate with context-dependent interaction characteristics, offering practical guidance for weight selection in real-world deployments.",

Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions. The source code will be made publicly available.",

Explicitly encoding the identities of active users would incur a significant overhead scaling logarithmically with the number of total users. Recently, via a random coding argument, Song, Attiah and Yu have shown that the overhead can be reduced to within some upper bound irrespective of the number of total users. In this remark, recognizing that the code design for DMRA is an instance of covering arrays in combinatorics, we show that there exists deterministic construction of variable-length codes that incur an overhead no greater than $1 + log_2 e$ bits.",

      "abstract": "Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.",

We prove that, under mild regularity conditions, Prog-PowerHP converges to a small neighborhood of the global optimum with an iteration complexity scaling nearly as $O(d^2\\varepsilon^{-2})$. Empirically, Prog-PowerHP demonstrates clear advantages in phase retrieval when the samples-to-dimension ratio approaches the information-theoretic limit, and in training two-layer neural networks in under-parameterized regimes. These results suggest that Prog-PowerHP is particularly effective for navigating cluttered non-convex landscapes where standard first-order methods struggle.",

We propose TeNet (Text-to-Network), a framework for instantiating compact, task-specific robot policies directly from natural language descriptions. TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control. These results show that text-conditioned hypernetworks offer a practical way to build compact, language-driven controllers for ressource-constrained robot control tasks with real-time requirements.",

This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul. Finally, we demonstrate how adapting its core urgency metric provides the flexibility to navigate the throughput-latency trade-off.",

Yet, dominant alignment approaches remain model centric, treating users as passive recipients of prespecified values rather than as epistemic agents who encounter and respond to misalignment during interactions. Drawing on situated perspectives, we frame alignment as an interactional practice co-constructed during human AI interaction. We investigate how users understand and wish to contribute to this process through a participatory workshop that combines misalignment diaries with generative design activities. We surface how misalignments materialise in practice and how users envision acting on them, grounded in the context of researchers using Large Language Models as research assistants. Our findings show that misalignments are experienced less as abstract ethical violations than as unexpected responses, and task or social breakdowns. Participants articulated roles ranging from adjusting and interpreting model behaviour to deliberate non-engagement as an alignment strategy. We conclude with implications for designing systems that support alignment as an ongoing, situated, and shared practice.",

The architectural change leads to a 35x speed-up for iterative inference with respect to the traditional HVAE.

To enable efficient knowledge learning and stable training, we incorporate a block diffusion continual pretraining (CPT) stage enhanced by a tailored warmup and block-wise clipped noise schedule. Under the same data and architecture, Stable-DiffCoder overall outperforms its AR counterpart on a broad suite of code benchmarks. Moreover, relying only on the CPT and supervised fine-tuning stages, Stable-DiffCoder achieves stronger performance than a wide range of \\~8B ARs and DLLMs, demonstrating that diffusion-based training can improve code modeling quality beyond AR training alone.

Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks.

By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.",

      "abstract": "The development of native computer-use agents (CUA) represents a significant leap in multimodal AI. However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.",

In this paper, first, we provide an extensive review and analysis of MIAs considering two main learning paradigms: centralized and federated learning. We extend and refine the taxonomy for both. Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs. Moreover, our findings suggest that using different surrogate models makes MIAs more effective.",

This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures.

      "abstract": "Table retrieval is the task of retrieving the most relevant tables from large-scale corpora given natural language queries. However, structural and semantic discrepancies between unstructured text and structured tables make embedding alignment particularly challenging. Recent methods such as QGpT attempt to enrich table semantics by generating synthetic queries, yet they still rely on coarse partial-table sampling and simple fusion strategies, which limit semantic diversity and hinder effective query-table alignment. We propose STAR (Semantic Table Representation), a lightweight framework that improves semantic table representation through semantic clustering and weighted fusion. STAR first applies header-aware K-means clustering to group semantically similar rows and selects representative centroid instances to construct a diverse partial table. It then generates cluster-specific synthetic queries to comprehensively cover the table's semantic space. Finally, STAR employs weighted fusion strategies to integrate table and query embeddings, enabling fine-grained semantic alignment. This design enables STAR to capture complementary information from structured and textual sources, improving the expressiveness of table representations. Experiments on five benchmarks show that STAR achieves consistently higher Recall than QGpT on all datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of semantic clustering and adaptive weighted fusion for robust table representation.

      "abstract": "In parliamentary elections, parties compete for a limited, typically fixed number of seats. Most parliaments are assembled using apportionment methods that distribute the seats based on the parties' vote counts. Common apportionment methods include divisor sequence methods (like D'Hondt or Sainte-Laguë), the largest-remainder method, and first-past-the-post. In many countries, an electoral threshold is implemented to prevent very small parties from entering the parliament. Further, several countries have apportionment systems that incorporate multiple districts. We study how computationally hard it is to change the election outcome (i.e., to increase or limit the influence of a distinguished party) by convincing a limited number of voters to change their vote. We refer to these bribery-style attacks as \\emph{strategic campaigns} and study the corresponding problems in terms of their computational (both classical and parameterized) complexity. We also run extensive experiments on real-world election data and study the effectiveness of optimal campaigns, in particular as opposed to using heuristic bribing strategies and with respect to the influence of the threshold and the influence of the number of districts. For apportionment elections with threshold, finally, we propose -- as an alternative to the standard top-choice mode -- the second-chance mode where voters of parties below the threshold receive a second chance to vote for another party, and we establish computational complexity results also in this setting.",

      "abstract": "Set Shaping Theory (SST) moves beyond the classical fixed-space model by constructing bijective mappings the original sequence set into structured regions of a larger sequence space. These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility, the software implementing the proposed method has been made publicly available on GitHub, enabling independent verification of the results reported in this work",

      "abstract": "General-purpose embedding models have demonstrated strong performance in text retrieval but remain suboptimal for table retrieval, where highly structured content leads to semantic compression and query-table mismatch. Recent LLM-based retrieval augmentation methods mitigate this issue by generating synthetic queries, yet they often rely on heuristic partial-table selection and seldom leverage these synthetic queries as supervision to improve the embedding model. We introduce CGPT, a training framework that enhances table retrieval through LLM-generated supervision. CGPT constructs semantically diverse partial tables by clustering table instances using K-means and sampling across clusters to broaden semantic coverage. An LLM then generates synthetic queries for these partial tables, which are used in hard-negative contrastive fine-tuning to refine the embedding model. Experiments across four public benchmarks (MimoTable, OTTQA, FetaQA, and E2E-WTQ) show that CGPT consistently outperforms retrieval baselines, including QGpT, with an average R@1 improvement of 16.54 percent. In a unified multi-domain corpus setting, CGPT further demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization and remains effective even when using smaller LLMs for synthetic query generation. These results indicate that semantically guided partial-table construction, combined with contrastive training from LLM-generated supervision, provides an effective and scalable paradigm for large-scale table retrieval.

The number is constrained by time and costs and lacks justification of the sample size requirements and their relationship to text vocabulary properties.   Methods: Using the publicly available MIMIC-III dataset containing hospital discharge notes with ICD-9 diagnoses as labels, we employed pre-trained BERT embeddings followed by Random Forest classifiers to identify 10 randomly selected diagnoses, varying training corpus sizes from 100 to 10,000 documents, and analyzed vocabulary properties by identifying strong and noisy predictive words through Lasso logistic regression on bag-of-words embeddings.   Results: Learning curves varied significantly across the 10 classification tasks despite identical preprocessing and algorithms, with 600 documents sufficient to achieve 95% of the performance attainable with 10,000 documents for all tasks. Vocabulary analysis revealed that more strong predictors and fewer noisy predictors were associated with steeper learning curves, where every 100 additional noisy words decreased accuracy by approximately 0.02 while 100 additional strong predictors increased maximum accuracy by approximately 0.04.",

However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.",

      "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training.

Sixty-nine translators took part in an in-person experiment, where they assessed three anonymized short stories - two written by ChatGPT-4o and one by a human author. For each story, participants rated the likelihood of AI authorship and provided justifications for their choices. While average results were inconclusive, a statistically significant subset (16.2%) successfully distinguished the synthetic texts from the human text, suggesting that their judgements were informed by analytical skill rather than chance. However, a nearly equal number misclassified the texts in the opposite direction, often relying on subjective impressions rather than objective markers, possibly reflecting a reader preference for AI-generated texts. Low burstiness and narrative contradiction emerged as the most reliable indicators of synthetic authorship, with unexpected calques, semantic loans and syntactic transfer from English also reported. In contrast, features such as grammatical accuracy and emotional tone frequently led to misclassification. These findings raise questions about the role and scope of synthetic-text editing in professional contexts.",

We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.",

A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique \"failure signature\", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.",

The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score.

A major empirical bottleneck in this area is the shortage of accurate and robust evaluation metrics for many languages, which hinders progress. Recent studies suggest that multilingual language models often use English as an internal pivot language, and that misalignment with this pivot can lead to degraded downstream performance. Motivated by the hypothesis that this mismatch could also apply to multilingual neural metrics, we ask whether steering their activations toward an English pivot can improve correlation with human judgments. We experiment with encoder- and decoder-based metrics and find that test-time intervention methods are effective across the board, increasing metric effectiveness for diverse languages.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.",

Yet realizing this potential symbiotically -- where biological and digital agents co-adapt and co-process -- remains elusive, largely due to the absence of a shared vocabulary bridging biology and computing. Consequently, microbes are often constrained to uni-directional roles, functioning as sensors or actuators rather than as active, computational partners in bio-digital systems. In response, we propose a taxonomy and pathways that articulate and expand the roles of biological and digital entities for synergetic bio-digital computation. Using this taxonomy, we analysed 70 systems across HCI, design, and engineering, identifying how biological mechanisms can be mapped onto computational abstractions. We argue that such mappings enable computationally actionable directions that foster richer and reciprocal relationships in bio-digital systems, supporting regenerative ecologies across time and scale while inspiring new paradigms for computation in HCI.",

      "abstract": "Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs) in objective tasks like mathematics and coding, there is growing interest in their potential to simulate human behavior--a capability with profound implications for transforming social science research and customer-centric business insights. However, LLMs often lack a nuanced understanding of human cognition and behavior, limiting their effectiveness in social simulation and personalized applications. We posit that this limitation stems from a fundamental misalignment: standard LLM pretraining on vast, uncontextualized web data does not capture the continuous, situated context of an individual's decisions, thoughts, and behaviors over time. To bridge this gap, we introduce HumanLLM, a foundation model designed for personalized understanding and simulation of individuals. We first construct the Cognitive Genome Dataset, a large-scale corpus curated from real-world user data on platforms like Reddit, Twitter, Blogger, and Amazon. Through a rigorous, multi-stage pipeline involving data filtering, synthesis, and quality control, we automatically extract over 5.5 million user logs to distill rich profiles, behaviors, and thinking patterns. We then formulate diverse learning tasks and perform supervised fine-tuning to empower the model to predict a wide range of individualized human behaviors, thoughts, and experiences. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that HumanLLM achieves superior performance in predicting user actions and inner thoughts, more accurately mimics user writing styles and preferences, and generates more authentic user profiles compared to base models. Furthermore, HumanLLM shows significant gains on out-of-domain social intelligence benchmarks, indicating enhanced generalization.",

We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.",

Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods.

Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.",

Our core contribution is a multi-level analysis workflow that (1) highlights patterns across persona traits, goals, and outcomes, (2) links agent reasoning to specific issues, and (3) supports actionable design improvements. UXCascade operationalizes this approach by listing agent goals, traits, and issues in a structured overview. Practitioners can explore detailed reasoning traces and annotated views, propose interface edits, and assess their impact across personas.

To address the need, we design and build FirmReBugger, a holistic framework for fairly assessing monolithic firmware fuzzers with a realistic, diverse, bug-based benchmark. FirmReBugger proposes using bug oracles--C syntax expressions of bug descriptors--with an interpreter to automate analysis and accurately report on bugs discovered, discriminating between states of detected, triggered, reached and not reached. Importantly, our idea of benchmarking does not modify the target binary and simply replays fuzzing seeds to isolate the benchmark implementation from the fuzzer while providing a simple means to extend with new bug oracles. Further, analyzing fuzzing roadblocks, we created FirmBench, a set of diverse, real-world binary targets with 313 software bug oracles. Incorporating our analysis of roadblocks challenging monolithic firmware fuzzing, the bench provides for rapid evaluation of future advances. We implement FirmReBugger in a FuzzBench-for-Firmware type service and use FirmBench to evaluate 9 state-of-the art monolithic firmware fuzzers in the style of a reproducibility study, using a 10 CPU-year effort, to report our findings.",

As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \\textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.",

      "abstract": "In hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), most deep learning models rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting their interpretability and hindering understanding of internal decision mechanisms. We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.",

      "abstract": "Large language models are increasingly used to represent human opinions, values, or beliefs, and their steerability towards these ideals is an active area of research. Existing work focuses predominantly on aligning marginal response distributions, treating each survey item independently. While essential, this may overlook deeper latent structures that characterise real populations and underpin cultural values theories. We propose a framework for evaluating the representativeness of aligned models through multivariate correlation patterns in addition to marginal distributions. We show the value of our evaluation scheme by comparing two model steering techniques (persona prompting and demographic fine-tuning) and evaluating them against human responses from the World Values Survey. While the demographically fine-tuned model better approximates marginal response distributions than persona prompting, both techniques fail to fully capture the gold standard correlation patterns. We conclude that representativeness is a distinct aspect of value alignment and an evaluation focused on marginals can mask structural failures, leading to overly optimistic conclusions about model capabilities.",

The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains.

However, their practical deployment is typically hindered by the inherent difficulty in enforcing vehicle dynamics and a critical reliance on accurate predictions of other agents, making them prone to safety issues under uncertain interactions. To address these limitations, we introduce DualShield, a planning and control framework that leverages Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability value functions in a dual capacity. First, the value functions act as proactive guidance, steering the diffusion denoising process towards safe and dynamically feasible regions. Second, they form a reactive safety shield using control barrier-value functions (CBVFs) to modify the executed actions and ensure safety. This dual mechanism preserves the rich exploration capabilities of diffusion models while providing principled safety assurance under uncertain and even adversarial interactions. Simulations in challenging unprotected U-turn scenarios demonstrate that DualShield significantly improves both safety and task efficiency compared to leading methods from different planning paradigms under uncertainty.",

      "abstract": "While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization.

Most existing models rely on static reasoning over uniformly sampled frames, which weakens temporal localization and leads to substantial information loss in long videos. Agentic tools such as temporal retrieval, spatial zoom, and temporal zoom offer a natural way to overcome these limitations by enabling adaptive exploration of key moments. However, constructing agentic video understanding data requires models that already possess strong long-form video comprehension, creating a circular dependency. We address this challenge with VideoThinker, an agentic Video Large Language Model trained entirely on synthetic tool interaction trajectories. Our key idea is to convert videos into rich captions and employ a powerful agentic language model to generate multi-step tool use sequences in caption space. These trajectories are subsequently grounded back to video by replacing captions with the corresponding frames, yielding a large-scale interleaved video and tool reasoning dataset without requiring any long-form understanding from the underlying model. Training on this synthetic agentic dataset equips VideoThinker with dynamic reasoning capabilities, adaptive temporal exploration, and multi-step tool use. Remarkably, VideoThinker significantly outperforms both caption-only language model agents and strong video model baselines across long-video benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of tool augmented synthetic data and adaptive retrieval and zoom reasoning for long-form video understanding.",

Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.",

      "abstract": "Understanding what users like is relatively straightforward; understanding what users dislike, however, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. Research into users' negative preferences has gained increasing importance in modern recommendation systems. Numerous platforms have introduced explicit negative feedback mechanisms and leverage such signals to refine their recommendation models. Beyond traditional business metrics, user experience-driven metrics, such as negative feedback rates, have become critical indicators for evaluating system performance. However, most existing approaches primarily use negative feedback as an auxiliary signal to enhance positive recommendations, paying little attention to directly modeling negative interests, which can be highly valuable in offline applications. Moreover, due to the inherent sparsity of negative feedback data, models often suffer from context understanding biases induced by positive feedback dominance. To address these challenges, we propose the first large language model framework for negative feedback modeling with special designed context-discerning modules. We use semantic ID Representation to replace text-based item descriptions and introduce an item-level alignment task that enhances the LLM's understanding of the semantic context behind negative feedback. Furthermore, we design a Progressive GRPO training paradigm that enables the model to dynamically balance the positive and negative behavioral context utilization. Besides, our investigation further reveals a fundamental misalignment between the conventional next-negative-item prediction objective and users' true negative preferences, which is heavily influenced by the system's recommendation order. To mitigate this, we propose a novel reward function and evaluation metric grounded in multi-day future negative feedback and their collaborative signals.",

      "abstract": "Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (DFJSS) is a complex combinatorial optimisation problem that requires simultaneous machine assignment and operation sequencing decisions in dynamic production environments. Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively.",

      "abstract": "Financial Generative Pre-trained Transformers (FinGPT) with multimodal capabilities are now being increasingly adopted in various financial applications. However, due to the intellectual property of model weights and the copyright of training corpus and benchmarking questions, verifying the legitimacy of GPT's model weights and the credibility of model outputs is a pressing challenge. In this paper, we introduce a novel zkFinGPT scheme that applies zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to high-value financial use cases, enabling verification while protecting data privacy. We describe how zkFinGPT will be applied to three financial use cases. Our experiments on two existing packages reveal that zkFinGPT introduces substantial computational overhead that hinders its real-world adoption. E.g., for LLama3-8B model, it generates a commitment file of $7.97$MB using $531$ seconds, and takes $620$ seconds to prove and $2.36$ seconds to verify.",

      "abstract": "Although artificial intelligence (AI) has become deeply integrated into various stages of the research workflow and achieved remarkable advancements, academic rebuttal remains a significant and underexplored challenge. This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) pipeline that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates strategy-grounded response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.

      "abstract": "We propose Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) for trustworthy LLMs, which represents the maximum range that a model can solve without any errors. While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.",

      "abstract": "Recent advances in LLM-based Text-to-SQL have achieved remarkable gains on public benchmarks such as BIRD and Spider. Yet, these systems struggle to scale in realistic enterprise settings with large, complex schemas, diverse SQL dialects, and expensive multi-step reasoning. Emerging agentic approaches show potential for adaptive reasoning but often suffer from inefficiency and instability-repeating interactions with databases, producing inconsistent outputs, and occasionally failing to generate valid answers. To address these challenges, we introduce Agent Semantic Memory (AgentSM), an agentic framework for Text-to-SQL that builds and leverages interpretable semantic memory. Instead of relying on raw scratchpads or vector retrieval, AgentSM captures prior execution traces-or synthesizes curated ones-as structured programs that directly guide future reasoning. This design enables systematic reuse of reasoning paths, which allows agents to scale to larger schemas, more complex questions, and longer trajectories efficiently and reliably. Compared to state-of-the-art systems, AgentSM achieves higher efficiency by reducing average token usage and trajectory length by 25% and 35%, respectively, on the Spider 2.0 benchmark. It also improves execution accuracy, reaching a state-of-the-art accuracy of 44.8% on the Spider 2.0 Lite benchmark.",

However, such improvements are inconsistent across different tasks or instances. This inconsistency suggests that zero-shot and role-play prompting may offer complementary strengths rather than one being universally superior. Building on this insight, we propose Persona Switch, a novel decoding method that dynamically combines the benefits of both prompting strategies. Our method proceeds step-by-step, selecting the better output between zero-shot and role-play prompting at each step by comparing their output confidence, as measured by the logit gap. Experiments with widely-used LLMs demonstrate that Persona Switch consistently outperforms competitive baselines, achieving up to 5.13% accuracy improvement. Furthermore, we show that output confidence serves as an informative measure for selecting the more reliable output.",

      "abstract": "Accurate alignment of multi-degree-of-freedom rehabilitation robots is essential for safe and effective patient training. This paper proposes a two-stage calibration framework for a self-designed three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) ankle rehabilitation robot. First, a Kronecker-product-based open-loop calibration method is developed to cast the input-output alignment into a linear parameter identification problem, which in turn defines the associated experimental design objective through the resulting information matrix. Building on this formulation, calibration posture selection is posed as a combinatorial design-of-experiments problem guided by a D-optimality criterion, i.e., selecting a small subset of postures that maximises the determinant of the information matrix. To enable practical selection under constraints, a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent is trained in simulation to choose 4 informative postures from a candidate set of 50. Across simulation and real-robot evaluations, the learned policy consistently yields substantially more informative posture combinations than random selection: the mean determinant of the information matrix achieved by PPO is reported to be more than two orders of magnitude higher with reduced variance. In addition, real-world results indicate that a parameter vector identified from only four D-optimality-guided postures provides stronger cross-episode prediction consistency than estimates obtained from a larger but unstructured set of 50 postures. The proposed framework therefore improves calibration efficiency while maintaining robust parameter estimation, offering practical guidance for high-precision alignment of multi-DOF rehabilitation robots.",

      "abstract": "As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.   The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.",

We introduce three lightweight refinements: (i) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (ii) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (iii) an $α$-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective.

      "abstract": "Although AI agents have demonstrated impressive capabilities in long-horizon reasoning, their reliability is severely hampered by the ``Spiral of Hallucination,'' where early epistemic errors propagate irreversibly. Existing methods face a dilemma: uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods typically act as passive sensors, only diagnosing risks without addressing them, while self-reflection mechanisms suffer from continuous or aimless corrections. To bridge this gap, we propose a unified Dual-Process Agentic UQ (AUQ) framework that transforms verbalized uncertainty into active, bi-directional control signals. Our architecture comprises two complementary mechanisms: System 1 (Uncertainty-Aware Memory, UAM), which implicitly propagates verbalized confidence and semantic explanations to prevent blind decision-making; and System 2 (Uncertainty-Aware Reflection, UAR), which utilizes these explanations as rational cues to trigger targeted inference-time resolution only when necessary. This enables the agent to balance efficient execution and deep deliberation dynamically. Extensive experiments on closed-loop benchmarks and open-ended deep research tasks demonstrate that our training-free approach achieves superior performance and trajectory-level calibration. We believe this principled framework AUQ represents a significant step towards reliable agents.",

Current approaches to evaluating data informativeness predominantly focus on the data's distribution or intrinsic information content and do not directly correlate with downstream task performance, such as mean average precision (mAP) in object detection. Thus, we propose Performance-guided (i.e. mAP-guided) Reinforced Active Learning for Object Detection (MGRAL), a novel approach that leverages the concept of expected model output changes as informativeness. To address the combinatorial explosion challenge of batch sample selection and the non-differentiable correlation between model performance and selected batches, MGRAL skillfully employs a reinforcement learning-based sampling agent that optimizes selection using policy gradient with mAP improvement as reward. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead of mAP estimation with unlabeled samples, MGRAL utilizes an unsupervised way with fast look-up tables, ensuring feasible deployment. We evaluate MGRAL's active learning performance on detection tasks over PASCAL VOC and COCO benchmarks. Our approach demonstrates the highest AL curve with convincing visualizations, establishing a new paradigm in reinforcement learning-driven active object detection.",

A TAP applet links a trigger to an action and must bind trigger outputs (ingredients) to action inputs (fields) to be executable. Prior work largely treats TAP as service-level prediction from natural language, which often yields non-executable applets that still require manual configuration. We study the function-level configuration problem: generating complete applets with correct ingredient-to-field bindings. We propose FARM (Field-Aware Resolution Model), a two-stage architecture for automated applet generation with full configuration. Stage 1 trains contrastive dual encoders with selective layer freezing over schema-enriched representations, retrieving candidates from 1,724 trigger functions and 1,287 action functions (2.2M possible trigger-action pairs). Stage 2 performs selection and configuration using an LLM-based multi-agent pipeline. It includes intent analysis, trigger selection, action selection via cross-schema scoring, and configuration verification. Agents coordinate through shared state and agreement-based selection. FARM achieves 81% joint accuracy on Gold (62% Noisy, 70% One-shot) at the function level, where both trigger and action functions must match the ground truth. For comparison with service-level baselines, we map functions to their parent services and evaluate at the service level. FARM reaches 81% joint accuracy and improves over TARGE by 23 percentage points. FARM also generates ingredient-to-field bindings, producing executable automation configurations.",

      "abstract": "Model editing updates a pre-trained LLM with new facts or rules without re-training, while preserving unrelated behavior. In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit \"hard writes\" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style \"hard preservation\" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.",

      "abstract": "We study mean estimation for Gaussian distributions under \\textit{personalized differential privacy} (PDP), where each record has its own privacy budget. PDP is commonly considered in two variants: \\textit{bounded} and \\textit{unbounded} PDP. In bounded PDP, the privacy budgets are public and neighboring datasets differ by replacing one record. In unbounded PDP, neighboring datasets differ by adding or removing a record; consequently, an algorithm must additionally protect participation information, making both the dataset size and the privacy profile sensitive. Existing works have only studied mean estimation over bounded distributions under bounded PDP. Different from mean estimation for distributions with bounded range, where each element can be treated equally and we only need to consider the privacy diversity of elements, the challenge for Gaussian is that, elements can have very different contributions due to the unbounded support. we need to jointly consider the privacy information and the data values. Such a problem becomes even more challenging under unbounded PDP, where the privacy information is protected and the way to compute the weights becomes unclear. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing optimal Gaussian mean estimators under both bounded and unbounded PDP, where in each setting we first derive lower bounds for both problems, following PDP mean estimators with the algorithmic upper bounds matching the corresponding lower bounds up to logarithmic factors.",

Yet agent testing remains nascent and is still a developing science. As AI agents begin to be deployed globally, it is important that they handle different languages and cultures accurately and securely.   To address this, participants from The International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the European Commission, France, Kenya, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have come together to align approaches to agentic evaluations.   This is the third exercise, building on insights from two earlier joint testing exercises conducted by the Network in November 2024 and February 2025. The objective is to further refine best practices for testing advanced AI systems.   The exercise was split into two strands: (1) common risks, including leakage of sensitive information and fraud, led by Singapore AISI; and (2) cybersecurity, led by UK AISI. A mix of open and closed-weight models were evaluated against tasks from various public agentic benchmarks. Given the nascency of agentic testing, our primary focus was on understanding methodological issues in conducting such tests, rather than examining test results or model capabilities. This collaboration marks an important step forward as participants work together to advance the science of agentic evaluations.",

      "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems integrate document retrieval with large language models and have been widely adopted. However, in privacy-related scenarios, RAG introduces a new privacy risk: adversaries can issue carefully crafted queries to exfiltrate sensitive content from the underlying corpus gradually. Although recent studies have demonstrated multi-turn extraction attacks, they rely on heuristics and fail to perform long-term extraction planning. To address these limitations, we formulate the RAG extraction attack as an adaptive stochastic coverage problem (ASCP). In ASCP, each query is treated as a probabilistic action that aims to maximize conditional marginal gain (CMG), enabling principled long-term planning under uncertainty. However, integrating ASCP with practical RAG attack faces three key challenges: unobservable CMG, intractability in the action space, and feasibility constraints. To overcome these challenges, we maintain a global attacker-side state to guide the attack. Building on this idea, we introduce RAGCRAWLER, which builds a knowledge graph to represent revealed information, uses this global state to estimate CMG, and plans queries in semantic space that target unretrieved regions. In comprehensive experiments across diverse RAG architectures and datasets, our proposed method, RAGCRAWLER, consistently outperforms all baselines. It achieves up to 84.4% corpus coverage within a fixed query budget and deliver an average improvement of 20.7% over the top-performing baseline. It also maintains high semantic fidelity and strong content reconstruction accuracy with low attack cost. Crucially, RAGCRAWLER proves its robustness by maintaining effectiveness against advanced RAG systems employing query rewriting and multi-query retrieval strategies. Our work reveals significant security gaps and highlights the pressing need for stronger safeguards for RAG.",

However, benchmarking efforts in LLMs for question answering often focus on medical exam questions, which differ significantly in style and content from the questions patients actually raise in real life. To bridge this gap, we sourced data from Google's People Also Ask feature by querying the top 200 prescribed medications in the United States, curating a dataset of medical questions people commonly ask. A considerable portion of the collected questions contains incorrect assumptions and dangerous intentions. We demonstrate that the emergence of these corrupted questions is not uniformly random and depends heavily on the degree of incorrectness in the history of questions that led to their appearance. Current LLMs that perform strongly on other benchmarks struggle to identify incorrect assumptions in everyday questions.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary sequential recommendation methods are becoming more complex, shifting from classification to a diffusion-guided generative paradigm. However, the quality of guidance in the form of user information is often compromised by missing data in the observed sequences, leading to suboptimal generation quality. Existing methods address this by removing locally similar items, but overlook ``critical turning points'' in user interest, which are crucial for accurately predicting subsequent user intent. To address this, we propose a novel Counterfactual Attention Regulation Diffusion model (CARD), which focuses on amplifying the signal from key interest-turning-point items while concurrently identifying and suppressing noise within the user sequence. CARD consists of (1) a Dual-side Thompson Sampling method to identify sequences undergoing significant interest shift, and (2) a counterfactual attention mechanism for these sequences to quantify the importance of each item. In this manner, CARD provides the diffusion model with a high-quality guidance signal composed of dynamically re-weighted interaction vectors to enable effective generation. Experiments show our method works well on real-world data without being computationally expensive. Our code is available at https://github.com/yanqilong3321/CARD.",

A within-subjects study with 26 transportation professionals demonstrates that structured multi-perspective feedback significantly improves designers' understanding of diverse user perspectives, ability to identify persona needs, and confidence in translating them into design decisions, with higher satisfaction and stronger intention for professional adoption. Qualitative findings reveal how conflict surfacing transforms design exploration from single-perspective optimization toward deliberate trade-off reasoning.

TempoNet captures fine-grained timing patterns and higher-order correlations such as host-pair behavior and seasonal trends, addressing key limitations of GAN-, LLM-, and Bayesian-based methods that fail to reproduce structured temporal variation. TempoNet produces temporally consistent, high-fidelity traces, validated on real-world datasets.

While diverse KD methods, including response based, feature based, and relation based approaches, capture different aspects of teacher knowledge, integrating multiple methods or knowledge sources is promising but often hampered by complex implementation, inflexible combinations, and catastrophic forgetting, which limits practical effectiveness.   This work proposes SMSKD (Sequential Multi Stage Knowledge Distillation), a flexible framework that sequentially integrates heterogeneous KD methods. At each stage, the student is trained with a specific distillation method, while a frozen reference model from the previous stage anchors learned knowledge to mitigate forgetting. In addition, we introduce an adaptive weighting mechanism based on the teacher true class probability (TCP) that dynamically adjusts the reference loss per sample to balance knowledge retention and integration.   By design, SMSKD supports arbitrary method combinations and stage counts with negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments show that SMSKD consistently improves student accuracy across diverse teacher student architectures and method combinations, outperforming existing baselines. Ablation studies confirm that stage wise distillation and reference model supervision are primary contributors to performance gains, with TCP based adaptive weighting providing complementary benefits. Overall, SMSKD is a practical and resource efficient solution for integrating heterogeneous KD methods.",

Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).   Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises (\"Sycophancy\").   This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.",

      "abstract": "Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.",

Historic datasets from related problems can be exploited to help improve performance of Bayesian optimisation by adapting transfer learning methods to various components of the Bayesian optimisation pipeline. In this study we perform an empirical analysis of various ensemble-based transfer learning Bayesian optimisation methods and pipeline components. We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance. We find that in general, two components that help improve transfer learning Bayesian optimisation performance are warm start initialisation and constraining weights used with ensemble surrogate model to be positive.",

In comparison, our forward scheme achieves a gradual improvement of proposals that converges toward the proposal targeted by these backward methods. We show that backward approaches can be numerically unstable even in simple settings. Our forward method, however, offers significantly greater robustness with only a minor trade-off in performance, measured by the variance of the marginal likelihood estimator. Numerical experiments on both simulated and real data illustrate the enhanced stability of our forward approach.",

We propose a new stopping criterion for efficient termination and preventing long runs of sampling in the stationary post-convergence phase of the algorithm and discuss Monte Carlo sample size choice. We run a series of simulation comparisons of spatial statistical models alongside the popular integrated nested Laplacian approximation method and demonstrate potential for similar or improved estimator performance and reduced running times. We also consider scaling of the algorithms to large datasets and demonstrate a greater than 100-fold reduction in running times using modern GPU hardware to illustrate the feasibility of full maximum likelihood methods with big spatial datasets.",

      "abstract": "Physics relies on mathematical spaces carefully matched to the phenomena under study. Phase space in classical mechanics, Hilbert space in quantum theory, configuration spaces in field theory all provide representations in which physical laws, stability and invariants become expressible and testable. In contrast, biology lacks an agreed-upon notion of space capturing context dependence, partial observability, degeneracy and irreversible dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce a unified mathematical space tailored to biological processes where states are represented in locally convex spaces indexed by context, where context includes both environment and history. Within our setting, proximity is defined through families of seminorms rather than a single global metric, allowing biological relevance to vary across conditions. Admissible sets encode biological constraints, observation maps formalize partial observability and many-to-one relations between state and dynamics capture irreversibility without requiring convergence to fixed points. Stabilization is characterized by neighborhood inclusion and degeneracy arises naturally through quotient structures induced by observation. We develop explicit constructions, operators and bounds within this space, yielding quantitative predictions dictated by its structure. A worked example based on EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer shows how single-cell data can be mapped into our framework, how numerical thresholds can be calibrated from the literature and how testable predictions can be formulated concerning rare tolerant states, context-dependent proximity and early stabilization. Overall, by providing biology with a space playing a role analogous to those used in physics, we aim to support structurally grounded and quantitative analyses of biological systems across contexts.",

In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information.

Conventional grid-based numerical methods, such as finite-difference and finite-element approaches, often require dense discretization and repeated forward simulations, leading to high computational cost in inverse problems. Although deep learning has shown promise in seismic applications, its performance is commonly limited by the need for large labeled datasets and weak enforcement of physical constraints.   In this study, we propose a unified physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for forward modeling and parameter inversion of viscoacoustic wave propagation. By embedding the viscoacoustic wave equation into the learning process, the proposed framework accurately reproduces wavefields, attenuation, and phase characteristics, while enabling the simultaneous inversion of velocity and attenuation parameters from temporally sparse observations.   Numerical experiments demonstrate that the PINN approach achieves stable and reliable accuracy compared with finite-difference solutions, while exhibiting reduced sensitivity to spatial discretization. These results highlight the potential of PINNs as a data-efficient and physically consistent alternative for high-resolution seismic modeling and inversion in attenuative media.",

      "title": "Quantum Dimension Reduction of Hidden Markov Models",
      "abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are ubiquitous in time-series modelling, with applications ranging from chemical reaction modelling to speech recognition. These HMMs are often large, with high-dimensional memories. A recently-proposed application of quantum technologies is to execute quantum analogues of HMMs. Such quantum HMMs (QHMMs) are strictly more expressive than their classical counterparts, enabling the construction of more parsimonious models of stochastic processes. However, state-of-the-art techniques for QHMM compression, based on tensor networks, are only applicable for a restricted subset of HMMs, where the transitions are deterministic. In this work we introduce a pipeline by which \\emph{any} finite, ergodic HMM can be compressed in this manner, providing a route for effective quantum dimension reduction of general HMMs. We demonstrate the method on both a simple toy model, and on a speech-derived HMM trained from data, obtaining favourable memory--accuracy trade-offs compared to classical compression approaches.",
