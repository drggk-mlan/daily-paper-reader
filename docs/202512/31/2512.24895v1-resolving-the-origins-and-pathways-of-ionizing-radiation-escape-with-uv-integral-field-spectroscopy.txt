Abstract. The Epoch of Reionization marks the last major phase transition in the early Universe, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen once filling the intergalactic medium was ionized by the first galaxies. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is now identifying promising galaxy candidates capable of producing sufficient ionizing photons to drive this transformation. However, the fraction of these photons that escape into intergalactic space—the escape fraction—remains highly uncertain. Stellar feedback is thought to play a critical role in carving low-density channels that allow ionizing radiation to escape, but the dominant mechanisms, their operation, and their connection to observable signatures are not well understood. Local analogs of high-redshift galaxies offer a powerful alternative for studying these processes, since ionizing radiation is unobservable at high redshift due to intergalactic absorption. However, current UV space-based instrumentation lacks the spatial resolution and sensitivity required to fully address this problem. The core challenge lies in the multiscale nature of LyC escape: ionizing photons are generated on scales of 1–100 pc in super star clusters but must traverse the circumgalactic medium which can extend beyond 100 kpc. The proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) will provide a platform for future UV instruments capable of resolving these scales. In this article, we present a science case for understanding how LyC photons escape from star-forming galaxies and define the observational requirements for future instruments aboard HWO, including a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS).

1 Introduction 

Approximately one billion years after the Big Bang, the universe experienced its last major phase transition, during which the majority of neutral hydrogen filling the intergalactic medium (IGM) became ionized. This era, known as the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), remains one of the last major 1

frontiers in cosmology. 1 Key questions, such as the exact duration of the EoR and the identity of the astrophysical objects responsible for reionizing the universe, remain unanswered. Early results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) suggest that star-forming (SF) galaxies produce enough ionizing, or Lyman continuum (LyC; < 912 ˚A), photons to reionize the universe. 2–5 However, it remains unclear how many of these photons actually escape from the first galaxies to ionize the IGM. Neutral gas and dust within the interstellar (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) efficiently absorb LyC photons, making escape unlikely without some form of intervention. Feedback processes—such as radiation pressure, stellar winds, and supernovae—are thought to create low-density channels that allow LyC photons to leak out. Yet, the dominant mechanism, how these processes operate, and how they connect to observable signatures are still open questions. Deciphering the physical mechanisms that govern LyC escape is inherently a multiscale prob-lem—spanning the production of LyC photons in super star clusters (SSCs; ∼1–100 pc) to their eventual escape through the circumgalactic medium (CGM; ∼1–100 kpc). Currently, the astro-nomical community lacks space-based instrumentation capable of resolving ultraviolet (UV) emis-sion on SSC scales. This limitation hinders our ability to pinpoint which type of feedback primar-ily facilitates LyC escape and how it links to various observables. The advent of a 6-meter-class, space-based observatory recommended by the 2020 Decadal Survey 6—the Habitable Worlds Ob-servatory (HWO)—will provide the light-gathering power required to enable a UV integral field spectrograph (IFS) capable of spatially resolving super star clusters (SSCs) and kinematically re-solving their galactic winds at high signal-to-noise. The goal of this paper is to define the spectro-scopic requirements imposed by this science case, whose demanding nature will naturally support a broader range of high-impact UV science programs. 2An earlier version of this work appeared as a Science Case Development Document (SCDD) in the conference proceedings of the “Towards the Habitable Worlds Observatory: Visionary Science and Transformational Technology” 2025 summer meeting, published by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. 

2 Science Case: Linking Stellar Feedback to LyC Escape and UV Observables 

The primary challenge to measuring a galaxy’s contribution to reionization lies in determining what fraction of its intrinsic LyC production actually goes on to ionize the IGM. This quantity is referred to as the LyC escape fraction ( f LyC esc ). Absorption in the neutral IGM prevents direct measurements of f LyC esc at high redshifts. 7 Consequently, astronomers must rely on local analogs of high redshift galaxies and simulations to develop diagnostics of f LyC esc to infer the contributions of individual galaxies to reionization. 8–11 For instance, high [O III] 5700 ˚ A/ [O II] 3726,9 ˚ A ratios (O32; 12–16 ) and steep non-ionizing UV continuum slopes ( βUV ;17–19 ) have all been linked to f LyC esc in local galaxies. These quantities contain information about the ionizing intensity and dust content, respectively. Most studies investigating LyC escape diagnostics rely on spatially integrated spectra, such as those obtained with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and therefore cannot capture spatial variations within galaxies. In reality, LyC production is highly localized, occurring primarily within super star clusters (SSCs) composed of massive O- and B-type stars—the dominant sources of ionizing radiation. Figure 1 demonstrates this localization, showing clustered star formation in UV images of two nearby SF galaxies. 20 

The Sunburst Arc, a strongly lensed LyC-emitting galaxy, offers a rare opportunity to study LyC escape at sub-galactic scales, approaching the level of individual clusters. The right panel of 3Fig 1 ACS/SBC synthetic filter images of two nearby SF galaxies. 20 Blue subplots show regions of diffuse Ly α emis-sion. We count roughly 20 (left panel) and 30 (right panel) distinct star clusters in each galaxy. Spatially resolving such features will be critical for understanding how LyC photons escape from galaxies and linking them to observational signatures. 

Figure 2 illustrates how LyC emission in the Sunburst Arc varies significantly across its surface along with the βU V and the O32 ratio. 21 The diagnostics differ substantially between LyC-emitting (black) and non-emitting regions (red), with O32 generally increasing in regions showing LyC emission. However, this physical connection between O32 and f LyC esc is lost when averaging over the entire galaxy, as is done in integrated spectroscopy (purple). For comparison, the right panel of Figure 2 displays 66 local galaxies drawn from the Low-z Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS; 22 ) according to these same diagnostics measured from in-tegrated spectra. The resulting distribution shows substantial scatter—particularly at intermedi-ate values of O32 and βU V , highlighting the loss of information. To meaningfully connect LyC escape with observable diagnostics—and to uncover the mechanisms underlying these connec-tions—analyzes must be carried out at the scale of individual stellar clusters. 4Fig 2 LyC escape according to the [O III] 5007 ˚ A / [O II] 3726,9 ˚ A ratio and the slope of the FUV continuum slope (β). The left panel shows values drawn from individual regions of the Sunburst Arc galaxy. Figure taken from, 21 with permission. The black points correspond to regions with LyC emission and the red points without. The purple point represents the average value measured over the whole galaxy. The left panel shows values derived from HST COS integrated spectra for entire galaxies selected from LzLCS. Data were taken from. 22, 23 To understand the relationship between f LyC esc and observables, we must resolve galaxies on the cluster scale. 

For LyC photons to escape from galaxies into the IGM, SSCs must clear their immediate sur-roundings and CGM of neutral hydrogen and dust. This clearing is driven by various feedback processes, including radiation pressure, stellar winds, and supernova explosions. Ram pressure from supernova-driven blast waves, for example, can launch massive, multiphase outflows that lift LyC-blocking clouds from the ISM, 24–26 while intense ionizing radiation from young stars may create escape pathways by ionizing low-column-density channels which naturally occur in turbu-lent media. 27, 28 The dominant feedback mechanism operating in a given region can be inferred from the age of the stellar populations—for instance, radiation feedback typically dominates in clusters younger than 3 Myr. 29, 30 Current observational evidence suggests that LyC escape is high-est during the earliest phases of star formation, when young, massive stars emit strong ionizing radiation prior to the onset of supernovae. 31–35 In contrast, simulations often favor later evolution-ary stages, when supernova-driven winds have had sufficient time to evacuate dense, LyC-blocking 5gas, 9, 25, 26, 36 where the LyC production is possibly dominated by binary stars. 37 Disentangling these mechanisms will require spectral imaging of the winds, down to the scale of the SSCs. The kinematic and geometric (density + distribution) properties of the different outflow phases needed to understand how winds shape their environments is reflected in the broadening of absorp-tion 38–42 and emission lines. 43–46 While empirical measures such as line widths can be recovered from low-resolution spectra (R < 5000), more nuanced parameters—such as density and velocity gradients—require high spectral resolution (R ∼ 15000 , or ∼ 20 km s −1) for effective radiative transfer modeling. 47, 48 However, spatially resolved spectra such as that obtainable with an IFS provides the most promising data set for constraining radial profiles. 48–50 Furthermore, mapping the winds on a cluster-by-cluster basis, as possible with both a multi-object spectrograph (MOS) or IFS would allow one to pair the feedback mechanism to the locations of LyC escape. Together, these advances would enable a definitive identification of the physical mechanisms driving LyC escape in the local universe and establish robust connections to LyC escape diagnostics observable at high-redshifts, thereby clarifying the contribution of SF galaxies to reionization. 

3 Desired Observations and Current Limitations 

To understand how LyC radiation escapes from galaxies, we must simultaneously map the H I and dust content of both the ISM and CGM, identify individual stellar populations, and constrain the kinematic and geometric properties of galactic winds. These goals can be achieved through the abundance of UV metal absorption lines observable at low redshifts, which trace a tempera-ture range of roughly 10 4–10 6 K. 51 In this section, we review the relevant observations and the resulting requirements imposed by our science case. All subsequent claims assume a standard flat cosmology with H0 = 70 km s −1 Mpc −1, Ωm = 0 .3, and ΩΛ = 0 .7.63.1 Lyman Continuum 

The LyC escape fraction can be measured directly from emission at wavelengths below the 912 ˚A Lyman limit. For instance, an empirical proxy is commonly used, where the flux near 900 ˚ Ais compared to the continuum flux around 1100 ˚ A. 22, 52, 53 Current constraints on f LyC esc have been measured using low-resolution spectroscopy ( R ∼ 1050 at 1100 ˚ A) with the COS G140L grating, which corresponds to an observed wavelength of 900 ˚ A at z = 0 .22 , typically at a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N = 5 .22 However, more recent studies indicate that the estimates f LyC esc can change significantly at R ∼ 5000 .35 The COS throughput sensitivity drops by roughly two-orders of magnitude below 1100 ˚ A, imposing a lower limit at this redshift. 54 Because we desire to spatially resolve LyC emission on the SSC scale (1-100 pc), the closer we can observe an object the better when observing at low redshifts. However, contamination from Milky Way absorption will become more and more problematic the closer we observe. There is an abundance of absorption lines that appear redward of the Lyman limit (e.g., L β, L γ, etc.) making clean observations of the LyC difficult. Realistically, z = 0 .16 is the lowest redshift at which we can comfortably observe LyC emission. At this redshift, the 900 ˚ A target will be redshifted to 1044 ˚ A in the observed frame. While most studies focus on stellar contributions to the LyC, in reality, there may be contri-butions coming from nebular emission as well - for instance, free electrons recombining to the first excited state of hydrogen will create a flux excess just below the Lyman limit at 912 ˚ A, often called the “Lyman bump”. 55 Since the nebular contribution is anticipated to be highly wavelength dependent, it may influence the perceived value for f LyC esc . To ensure separation from the nebular contribution, a broader wavelength range of 700–912 ˚ A would be ideal, as the 700 ˚ A mark is likely far enough away from the nebular contributions from higher order H I transitions. 56 If we extend 7to even bluer wavelengths, down to 400 ˚ A, we would also be able to measure the He Lyman bump below its Lyman limit at 504 ˚ A. This must be done at much higher redshifts, however. For exam-ple, 400 ˚ A would be observed at 1100 ˚ A at z = 1 .75 . Reports of possible LyC detections have been made using COS at R = 1250 − 2400 at 1500 ˚ A over the restframe wavelength range 770 -912 ˚ A. 57 

Flux sensitivity is also an important property to consider when measuring f LyC esc . As a lower limit, the observed flux (accounting for IGM absorption) at 900 ˚ A is projected to be about 10 −19 

erg/s/cm 2/ ˚ A or about 30 absolute magnitudes for f LyC esc = 0 .3% in typical SF galaxies. These numbers drop by about one dex out to z = 1 and by two dex at z = 3 .58 

The following lines will be useful in the study of galactic winds. 

3.2 Lyman Alpha 

The H I 1216 ˚ A Lyman alpha (Ly α) line is the best known proxy of LyC emission. A double peaked emission feature is often observed in SF galaxies with the peak separation showing a negative correlation with f LyC esc .8, 15, 59–62 Ly α acts as a direct and sensitive probe of the neutral gas and dust distribution in galaxies and galactic outflows. 63, 64 The Ly α absorption feature has been linked to the high velocity profile of various metal lines. 50 Rather surprisingly, Ly α emission is frequently observed at high redshifts, 65 likely following the escape through ionized bubbles, 66 keeping the door open for its use as a probe of f LyC esc at high redshifts. 

3.3 Lyman Series 

The Lyman series—spanning from Ly β at 1026 ˚ A, Ly γ at 972.5 ˚ A, Ly δ at 949.7 ˚ A, and Ly ϵ at 937.8 ˚A down to the Lyman limit at 911.8 ˚ A—provides another direct probe of neutral hydrogen. Unlike 8Ly α, the higher-order Lyman lines typically lack a strong nebular emission component and instead appear in absorption or as P Cygni profiles, offering a valuable window into the physical state of the ISM and outflows. Their generally lower oscillator strengths at short wavelengths (e.g., Ly β–Ly ϵ:0.079–0.008) lead to lower optical depths, creating more favorable conditions for radiative transfer modeling. The absorption spectra of the Lyman series also present an ideal comparison to metal absorption lines, enabling studies of how metals trace neutral hydrogen. Although the high-energy end of the series often suffers from line blending and foreground contamination from the Milky Way at low redshifts, relatively clean Lyman series absorption features have been observed at redshifts ∼0.3 with COS. 35, 67 

3.4 LIS Metal Lines 

Low-ionization state (LIS) metal lines such as Si II 1190 ˚ A, 1193 ˚ A, 1265 ˚ A, 1393 ˚ A, 1527 ˚ A act as direct probes of the cold clouds ( 10 4 K) that trace the winds of galaxies and ISM. Si II lines, in particular, have been explored as potential diagnostics of LyC escape. 68 Moreover, when combined with the higher ionization states lines of Si III 1206 ˚ A and Si IV 1393 ˚ A, 1403 ˚ A, Si II lines have been used to map the ionization structure of galactic winds and constrain the abundances of neutral and total hydrogen. 69–71 Additional lines include N II 1084 ˚ A, O I 1302 ˚ A, and C II 1334 ˚ A. Like the Lyman series, these lines also appear in absorption or as P Cygni profiles. As metal lines, they typically have much lower column densities than H I, creating ideal conditions for radiative transfer modeling. Metal lines with fluorescent components, such as Si II 1190 ˚ A (Si II* 1194 ˚ A) and Si II 1193 ˚A (Si II* 1197 ˚ A), offer an ideal opportunity to probe pure absorption profiles, absent blue emis-sion infilling. 38, 39 While resonant emission can fill in absorption wells, fluorescent emission will 9appear away at longer wavelengths. Therefore, fluorescent lines offer an ideal opportunity to dis-tinguish different absorption components, including the redshifted absorption signatures of galactic inflows. 72 

3.5 WIS Metal Lines 

Warm-ionization state (WIS) metal tracers such as N III 990 ˚ A, C III 977 ˚ A, O VI 1032 ˚ A, 1038 ˚A, Si IV 1394 ˚ A, 1403 ˚ A, C IV 1548 ˚ A, 1551 ˚ A offer a potential probe of the warm-hot ( 10 5.5

K) phase of galactic winds. These lines offer a constraint on the most rapidly cooling gas in the CGM, that is prime for re-accretion onto the galaxy, making them ideal probes for how galactic inflows may affect LyC escape. 73 C IV, in particular, has been linked to catastrophic cooling and suppressed winds. 74 When combined with LIS lines, WIS lines can be used to further map the ionization structure of the winds, where the majority of mass is typically believed to occupy the cold + warm phases. 75–77 

Galactic winds can extend tens to hundreds of kiloparsecs into the CGM, with the cool phase generally reaching shorter distances. 69, 70 For LzLCS galaxies, the mean Ly α half-light radius 

r50 = 3 .3 kpc , while the mean 90% light radius r90 = 11 .7 kpc .78 Observations with COS at low redshift are limited by its 1.25 ′′ aperture, which subtends a physical scale of only 3.4 kpc at 

z = 0 .22 (e.g., 79 ). 

3.6 FUV spectral energy distribution 

Modeling the FUV spectral energy distribution (SED) using BPASS or Starburst99 can provide valuable insights into the relative ages of stellar populations, which in turn can help identify the dominant source of feedback (i.e., radiation vs. supernovae; 33–35 ), metallicities, and star formation 10 histories. 80 Key diagnostic features include the stellar wind lines OVI 1307 ˚ A and N V 1240 ˚ A, which are particularly sensitive to stellar population age, 19 and the photospheric line C III 117 ˚ A, which is sensitive to metallicity. 81 The aforementioned lines can be well captured at low resolution 

R = 1000 ,81 but higher resolution R = 3000 −5000 is required to distinguish absorption in galactic winds, particularly in photospheric lines. 35 Photospheric lines generally fall between 1000 − 1800 

˚A and wind lines from 1030 − 1550 ˚A. 

4 Discussion and Requirements 

In this section, we discuss the prospects for future instrumentation enabled by the HWO and the observational requirements needed to resolve the origins and pathways of LyC escape in nearby SF galaxies. We delineate the science into three tiers—state-of-the-art, moderate progress, and trans-formational capability—with the latter representing a substantial advance beyond what is currently feasible with HST. The COS spectrograph currently enables medium-resolution integrated spectroscopy of star-forming galaxies. For example, using the G130M grating, achieving a S/N = 10 at a spectral resolution of R = 4000 or ∼ 75 km s −1 near 1000 ˚ A requires ∼ 11 hours (12 HST orbits) when observing the star-forming galaxy J115205+340050, a known LyC emitter ( f LyC esc = 13% , z =0.3419 ;22 ). While feasible, such exposure times are costly, contributing to the scarcity of high-resolution, high-S/N spectra of LyC leakers in the literature. However, the few observations that meet these requirements reveal multiple kinematic components in galactic wind absorption lines, demonstrating that additional and physically meaningful structure appears when this resolution is reached. 35 

Tests against simulations show that the properties of cool galactic outflows–column density 11 (σ ∼ 1.3 dex), opening angle ( σ ∼ 10 deg), and flow rates ( σ ∼ 0.5 dex)–can be teased out from spectral lines at a resolution R = 15 , 000 and S/N = 10 . Similar studies have also proposed reach-ing R = 6000 to capture the absorption properties of galactic inflows. 72 At higher resolution– R = 30 , 000 − 100 , 000 –we would be able to probe spectra down to the turbulent/thermal velocity regime. This is the smallest scale at which additional structure could be detected, potentially revealing the cold clouds or multiphase structure of the CGM. 82 

Using the HWO UV Spectrograph simulator 1, we estimate that a S/N = 10 at a spectral resolution of ∼ 75 km s −1 near 1000 ˚ A can be achieved in just ∼ 24 (13) minutes with a 6 (8)-meter aperture. At this level of gathering power, what is now state-of-the-art would become routine with HWO. However, to enable truly transformational science and identify how LyC photons escape from galaxies, high-resolution spectral imaging is required. To image SSCs (1-100 pc) at redshift 

z = 0 .22 , a resolution of 0.28-28 mas is required. These values become 0.36-36 mas at z = 0 .16 .A 6 (8)-meter aperture becomes diffraction limited at 4.6 (3.5) mas at 1100 ˚ A, pushing us close to what is possible. A 3′′ × 3′′ (∼ 10 .6 kpc at z = 0 .22 ) field of view (FOV) would allow us to capture the majority of the Ly α halo. To capture the full CGM, an even larger field of view ( 5 − 10 ′′ ) would be required. A UV IFS would be ideal, providing optimal conditions for radiative transfer modeling (e.g., 49, 50 ). A multi-object spectrograph (MOS) would also be valuable, requiring observations of ∼ 20–50 tar-gets per galaxy to capture all LyC-emitting clusters. In practice, a combination of instruments will likely be required to fully characterize how LyC radiation escapes from local star-forming galaxies. An IFS with a spectral resolution of R ∼ 5,000 , sub–30 mas spatial resolution, and a 3′′ × 3′′ field of view would enable transformational advances. Higher spectral resolution ( R ∼ 30 ,000) may be

12 more readily achieved with a MOS, while probing the highest-resolution kinematics of the CGM may require an ´ echelle spectrograph. A summary of the observational requirements is provided in Table 1.

# List of Figures 

1 ACS/SBC synthetic filter images of two nearby SF galaxies. 20 Blue subplots show regions of diffuse Ly α emission. We count roughly 20 (left panel) and 30 (right panel) distinct star clusters in each galaxy. Spatially resolving such features will be critical for understanding how LyC photons escape from galaxies and linking them to observational signatures. 2 LyC escape according to the [O III] 5007 ˚ A / [O II] 3726,9 ˚ A ratio and the slope of the FUV continuum slope ( β). The left panel shows values drawn from individual regions of the Sunburst Arc galaxy. Figure taken from, 21 with permission. The black points correspond to regions with LyC emission and the red points without. The purple point represents the average value measured over the whole galaxy. The left panel shows values derived from HST COS integrated spectra for entire galaxies selected from LzLCS. Data were taken from. 22, 23 To understand the re-lationship between f LyC esc and observables, we must resolve galaxies on the cluster scale. 25 List of Tables
