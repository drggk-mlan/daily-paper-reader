## ABSTRACT 

Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video’s lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject’s lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based in-painting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning (i.e., masked video frames and misaligned appearance references) forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Dif-fusion Transformer (DiT), first as a data generator , to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input con-

ditioning forms a rich “visual context” for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions (e.g., lighting and occlusions), and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and ex-ceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further intro-duce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive bench-mark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios. 

## 1 INTRODUCTION 

Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize an existing video’s lip movements with new speech (KR et al., 2019). Unlike audio-driven animation (Tian et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2024a), which generates entire videos from scratch, dubbing requires modifying only the speech-relevant regions while strictly preserving identity and other visual cues from the original video. This uniqueness un-derpins dubbing’s broad applications, from personalized avatars (Thies et al., 2020) to multilingual film translation (Prajwal et al., 2020). The recent rise of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) (Peebles & Xie, 2023) has demonstrated their remarkable generation capability in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) tasks, making them natural candidates for high-fidelity visual dubbing. Yet dubbing presents a distinctive challenge. As a video-to-video task, it ideally requires paired training data where lip movements differ while identity, pose, and environment remain unchanged; obtaining such paired data is physically impossible in the real world. This fundamental data constraint has historically forced existing approaches into a mask-inpainting paradigm (Prajwal et al., 2020): they mask the lower half of the face in a video and train a model to inpaint it conditioned on the corresponding audio and sparse reference frames. While enabling self-supervised reconstruction without paired data, this design inevitably degrades visual condition-ing by stripping visual information from the lower facial region and relying on often misaligned, sparse references. Consequently, the inpainting model must not only reconstruct synchronized lip motion, but simultaneously hallucinate missing content (e.g., facial occlusions absent in references) and extract identity appearance from pose-misaligned reference frames. This divided attention com-promises precise lip synchronization, further exacerbated by mask-boundary lip-shape leakage and weak audio conditioning (Wang et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2025), while also inducing identity drift and visual artifacts (Zhong et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2025). Ultimately, these failures reveal a fun-damental disconnect: the training paradigm renders the task ill-posed by restricting the “visual context” —the visual conditioning information available to the model—to a fragmented state (i.e., masked frames and misaligned references), preventing it from leveraging the complete video con-text (i.e., the full input video) that is actually available during inference. Therefore, we argue that achieving high-quality visual dubbing does not hinge on improving existing inpainting architectures, but on fundamentally breaking away from this mask-inpainting paradigm. We therefore propose a new perspective that directly confronts this data bottleneck to restore the task to its intrinsic editing nature . Instead of circumventing the problem with the mask-inpainting paradigm, we present X-Dub , a novel self-bootstrapping framework that leverages the generative priors of a pre-trained DiT model to synthesize ideal paired training data for itself. Specifically, a DiT-based generator first synthesizes a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, creat-ing visually aligned pairs that share identical identity, pose, and scene but differ in lip motion. A subsequent DiT-based editor then learns dubbing directly from these video pairs, taking the full companion video as input to perform mask-free editing. In this way, we transform dubbing from an 

ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned editing problem guided by complete, frame-aligned visual context, fundamentally aligning the solution with the definition of visual dubbing. Concretely, the generator is instantiated akin to a conventional mask-inpainting model trained on large-scale audiovisual data via self-reconstruction. Once trained, it operates offline to inpaint the masked source video conditioned on alternative audio, producing a lip-altered companion to con-struct a synthetic-real training pair. Crucially, within our framework, the generator functions not as 2the final dubbing solver but as a contextual condition synthesizer. This role shift allows us to make a principled trade-off: we optimize primarily for identity preservation and spatiotemporal robustness, minimizing artifacts even at the cost of perfect lip-sync accuracy. This yields a synthetic companion that serves as a rich “visual context” , providing all visual information aligned with the target real video—including rich identity cues, complete scene interactions (e.g., lighting and occlusions), and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics—except for the target lip motion. Consequently, learning from these aligned pairs, the editor faces a significantly simplified task: it can dedicate its full capacity to precise speech-driven lip editing while seamlessly inheriting all other visual factors from this com-plete context, ultimately achieving superior lip-sync accuracy, identity preservation, and robustness to visual variations. Reframing visual dubbing as targeted editing, however, introduces unique conflicting goals: the model must simultaneously inherit global structure, edit local lips, and preserve fine-grained texture. A monolithic learning approach often struggles to balance these objectives. We therefore introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy with LoRA experts as a necessary component for the editor . We leverage the inherent tendency of diffusion models to capture distinct information levels at different timesteps (Zhang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025; Liang et al., 2025; Peng et al., 2025). By aligning early, mid, and late diffusion stages with global structure, lip shape, and texture refinement, respectively, we disentangle these conflicting objectives, allowing the model to learn complementary tasks at their most effective phases, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip-sync accuracy and visual quality. Finally, we note that existing visual dubbing benchmarks (Afouras et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021) are confined to controlled settings with limited motion and diversity, insufficient for evaluating ro-bustness in realistic scenarios. We therefore introduce ContextDubBench , a benchmark built from both real-world footage and advanced generative content, encompassing varied motions, environ-ments, styles, and subjects to enable comprehensive evaluation under complex dubbing conditions. In summary, our contributions are: 1) We propose a self-bootstrapping visual dubbing framework 

that leverages pre-trained DiT models both as a data generator to synthesize aligned training video pairs and as an audio-driven editor trained on them for the final dubbing task, transforming the task from an ill-posed inpainting problem into a well-conditioned editing one guided by complete visual context. 2) We introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, facilitating stable contextual learning and yielding enhanced lip sync and visual fidelity. 3) We construct and release 

ContextDubBench , a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate visual dubbing models in challenging real-world and generative scenarios. 4) Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves remarkable improvements across all metrics, significantly outperforming existing approaches with more accurate lip sync, superior identity preservation, and exceptional robustness to spatiotemporal variations. 

## 2 RELATED WORK 

Visual dubbing. Early visual dubbing methods leverage GANs (Goodfellow et al., 2014) for mask-based inpainting. LipGAN (KR et al., 2019) pioneers this direction with reference-guided synthesis, while Wav2Lip (Prajwal et al., 2020) improves lip sync through SyncNet (Chung & Zisserman, 2016). Subsequent works extend this paradigm: VideoReTalking (Cheng et al., 2022) introduces canonical references to mitigate expression bias, DINet (Zhang et al., 2023) enables high-resolution synthesis via deformation inpainting, and TalkLip (Wang et al., 2023) enhances lip intelligibility using AV-HuBERT (Shi et al., 2022). IP-LAP (Zhong et al., 2023) and StyleSync (Guan et al., 2023) further strengthen identity preservation through landmark- and style-aware optimization. Recent diffusion-based approaches also exhibit advanced performance. DiffTalk (Shen et al., 2023) and Diff2Lip (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2024) demonstrate the feasibility of diffusion, while MuseTalk (Zhang et al., 2024) achieves real-time synthesis by combining latent diffusion with ad-versarial training. LatentSync (Li et al., 2024) adapts pre-trained diffusion models with temporal supervision to improve stability. Nevertheless, these methods largely follow a self-reconstruction paradigm based on masked frames and sparse references, which limits contextual richness. By con-trast, our approach introduces a contextual conditioning paradigm , where paired videos provide informative context, allowing the model to focus on accurate lip editing with stronger stability. 3Contextual Data Construction (3.1)

Figure 2: Overview of X-Dub, our self-bootstrapping dubbing framework. At its core, our paradigm employs a DiT generator to create a lip-altered counterpart for each video, forming a context-rich pair with the original (left). A DiT editor then learns mask-free, video-to-video dub-bing directly from these ideal pairs, leveraging the complete visual context to ensure accurate lip sync and identity preservation (middle). This contextual learning is further refined by our timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning (right), which aligns different diffusion stages with learning distinct information: global structure, lip movements, and texture details, respectively. 

Audio-driven portrait animation. Another related line of work is audio-driven portrait animation, which generates talking videos from still images or text prompts. Recent DiT-based models achieve expressive talking-head (Tian et al., 2024; Cui et al., 2024a), half-body (Cui et al., 2024b; Meng et al., 2025), and full-body results (Wang et al., 2025; Lin et al., 2025). These works demonstrate the power of DiTs for human-centric generation in I2V or T2V paradigms. Visual dubbing instead is a stricter video-to-video editing task: it requires precise speech-driven modifications while preserving other visual cues, enabling seamless integration into recorded videos. 

## 3 OUR APPROACH 

As illustrated in Fig. 2, we establish a self-bootstrapping dubbing framework where a DiT model both generates visually aligned video pairs with varied lip motion and learns dubbing from them, thereby reframing dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting problem into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing task. We first present the DiT-based generator , trained with a mask-inpainting self-reconstruction objective to synthesize lip-varied companion videos that serve purely as contextual inputs (Sec. 3.1). To ensure these synthetic companions serve as reliable visual conditioning, we introduce principled construction strategies that prioritize identity preservation and robustness over secondary lip accuracy and generalization, further employing rigorous quality filtering and augmen-tations to minimize artifacts and maximize visual alignment (Sec. 3.1.2). On top of such curated video pairs, the DiT-based editor learns mask-free dubbing as rich-context-driven editing, achiev-ing accurate lip sync, faithful identity retention, and resilience to pose and occlusion variations (Sec. 3.2). Finally, we propose a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning scheme (Sec. 3.3) that aligns diffusion stages with complementary objectives—structure, lips, and textures—to facilitate stable training convergence within this editing paradigm and further enhance dubbing quality. 

DiT backbone. Our DiT backbone follows the latent diffusion paradigm with a 3D VAE for video compression and a DiT for token sequence modeling (Peebles & Xie, 2023). Each DiT block com-bines 2D spatial and 3D spatio-temporal self-attention with cross-attention for external conditions. 43.1 GENERATOR : C ONTEXTUAL CONDITION CONSTRUCTOR 

3.1.1 NA¨IVE MASK DUBBING 

We implement the DiT-based generator under a mask-based self-reconstruction scheme following prior dubbing methods. Given a target video Vtgt with audio atgt , we apply a facial mask M and reconstruct masked regions ˆVtgt conditioned on atgt and a reference frame Iref .Although this setup yields imperfect dubbing outputs, the generator is not designed to solve dub-bing directly, but solely to synthesize companion videos as contextual inputs for the editor in our framework. By altering lip motion within otherwise consistent frames, the generator transforms sparse inpainting contexts into aligned video pairs far stronger than static reference frames. 𝒛 mask

Figure 3: Conditioning mechanisms for our DiT-based framework . Reference con-ditions (full contextual video frames for ed-itor ; a single reference frame for generator )and the target video are concatenated into a unified sequence for 3D self-attention. Au-dio is injected via cross-attention. 

Conditioning mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 3, masked and target frames are encoded by a VAE into zmask , ztgt ∈ Rb×f ×c×h×w, and the refer-ence frame into zref ∈ Rb×c×h×w. We con-catenate zmask with noised ztgt channel-wise, and zero-pad zref for channel alignment. Concatenat-ing across frames yields the unified DiT input zin = [0, zref ]ch , [zmask , ztgt ]ch

, which enables interac-tion between video and reference tokens via 3D self-attention. Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) features are injected through cross-attention as audio condi-tion. To extend generation to long videos, we use motion frames (Tian et al., 2024): each segment is conditioned on the last frames of the previous one. During training, the first m = 2 frames of ztgt re-main unnoised as motion guidance. Conditional dropout (50%) handles the absence of prior frames in initial segments. 

Training objective. We adopt a flow-matching loss LFM (details in Appendix. A.1), weighted by face and lip masks M , Mlip from DWPose (Yang et al., 2023) via element-wise multiplication ( ⊙): 

LwFM = (1 + λM + λlip Mlip ) ⊙ L FM . (1) Trained in this manner, the generator produces a synthetic companion video V ′ for each real clip V

by replacing its original audio a with an alternative a′, yielding frame-aligned but lip-varied paired videos (V ′, V ). Here, V ′ serves solely as the conditional input for the editor .3.1.2 PRINCIPLED PAIR CONSTRUCTION STRATEGIES 

Plain mask-based dubbing inevitably yields imperfect results. We therefore design explicit trade-off strategies within our generator ’s data construction process to ensure that the synthetic companion video, while not flawless, serves as a reliable contextual input, turning the generator from a na¨ ıve dubber to a reliable contextual condition provider. To this end, we establish three guiding principles for our data construction process: 1) In-domain quality over generalization. The generator should focus on fidelity within the training distribution rather than broad generalization. 2) Visual consistency under variation. Companion videos must maintain identity and remain robust to pose, occlusion, and illumination changes. 3) Lip variation over accuracy. Lip shapes in V ′ should differ from V to avoid leakage, while tolerating moderate lip-sync inaccuracies. Accordingly, we implement several strategies specifically for the generator during the paired data construction phase. First, we leverage short-term visual stationarity by having the generator process videos in brief, 25-frame segments where pose and scene remain relatively stable. During this data-creation inference, intra-segment reference frames are selected to provide roughly aligned visual information for each shorter clip. Motion frames then connect these segments into complete 77-frame videos for the subsequent editor training, which exhibit minimal identity and color drift as a result of this process. While lip accuracy may degrade across segment boundaries, this trade-off favors visual consistency as intended. We also sample alternative audio a′ from the same speaker as 5V to reduce cross-identity conflicts and apply extended training beyond nominal convergence to improve identity preservation and lip sync. To enhance robustness to diverse variations, we incorporate complementary techniques. We handle 

occlusions by annotating and excluding facial occluders from inpainting areas, enabling the gen-erator to be more robust to occlusion scenarios. For lighting augmentation , we apply identical relighting to both V and V ′ in uniformly-lit videos to construct pairs with consistent lighting dy-namics (Bian et al., 2025). We also perform quality filtering using landmark distance, identity similarity, and overall visual quality scores to ensure sufficient lip divergence, identity preservation, and high visual fidelity. Additionally, we supplement with 3D-rendered data to obtain perfectly aligned pairs. Implementation details are in Appendix B. Together, these data construction strategies ensure the generator produces lip-varied video pairs that, though not perfect, consistently provide strong and reliable conditions for the editor .3.2 EDITOR : C ONTEXT -D RIVEN VIDEO -TO -V IDEO DUBBER 

Given curated pairs (V ′, V ), we train a DiT-based editor for mask-free dubbing. Unlike the gen-erator , the editor tackles dubbing directly: given audio a and the companion video V ′, it learns to produce V as the target, thereby transforming dubbing from a sparse inpainting problem into context-driven editing. In practice, the editor surpasses the generator across lip accuracy, identity preservation, and robustness, benefiting from the rich contextual input provided by the paired videos. 

Contextual conditioning mechanisms. As shown in Fig. 3, the paired reference and target videos are encoded as latents zref , ztgt ∈ Rb×f ×c×h×w. The diffused ztgt is then concatenated with clean 

zref across frames, forming zin ∈ Rb×2f ×c×h×w. Patchifying this sequence enables contextual in-teraction via 3D self-attention, minimally altering the DiT backbone while fully exploiting its con-textual modeling capacity. Audio features and motion frames are integrated identically to Sec. 3.1. 3.3 TIMESTEP -A DAPTIVE MULTI -P HASE LEARNING WITH LORA E XPERTS 

While lip-varied video pairs significantly simplify dubbing, training the editor must still balance inheriting global structure, editing lip motion, and preserving fine-grained identity details. Diffusion models exhibit stage-wise specialization across timesteps (Zhang et al., 2025; Wang et al., 2025), motivating us to introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase scheme, where different noise regions target complementary objectives. 

Phase partitioning. Following Esser et al. (2024), we shift the timestep sampling distribution to concentrate on different noise levels for each training phase: 

tshift = αt orig 

1 + ( α − 1) torig 

, (2) where torig is logit-normal and α sets the shift strength. This yields: 1) high-noise steps for global structure and motion, including background layout, head pose, and coarse identity; 2) mid-noise steps for lip movements; 3) low-noise steps for texture refinement concerning identity details. 

High-noise full training. We first train the editor under the high-noise distribution with full-parameter optimization. This setting not only facilitates convergence and improves generation qual-ity (Esser et al., 2024), but also encourages the model to learn global structures effectively, thus seamlessly transferring background, head pose, overall identity, and other spatiotemporal dynamics from reference contexts while achieving preliminary lip sync. The training objective is the same mask-weighted flow-matching loss LwFM as in Eq. 1. 

Mid- and low-noise tuning with LoRA experts. We then attach lightweight LoRA modules for mid- and low-noise phases. Since pixel-level constraints are needed, we design a single-step denois-ing strategy to avoid computational overhead during training: 

ˆx0 = D(z0 + ( v − ˆv) · min {t, t thres }), (3) where tthres ensures stable denoising at high noise levels (see Appendix C for detailed derivation). The lip expert operates at mid-noise, supervised by an additional lip-sync loss Lsync using Sync-Net (Chung & Zisserman, 2016) for audio-visual alignment. The texture expert works at low-noise 6Table 1: Quantitative results on HDTF. Top three are highlighted as first , second , and third .

with identity loss Lid computed against references using ArcFace (Deng et al., 2019) and CLIP (Rad-ford et al., 2021) features. To avoid hurting sync, we randomly disable audio cross-attention (prob-ability 0.5) during texture tuning, computing texture supervision only under silent conditions. During inference, we activate each LoRA within its optimal timestep range: texture expert for t ∈

[0 , 0.3] and lip expert for t ∈ [0 .4, 0.8] , ensuring each contributes where most effective. Details on the selection of timestep ranges can be found in Appendix C.3. 

## 4 EXPERIMENTS 

Benchmark. To evaluate visual dubbing in practical settings, we construct ContextDubBench, a challenging benchmark of 440 video-audio pairs combining real-world and AI-generated content. Videos feature challenging scenarios like profile views, pose shifts, occlusions, and stylized appear-ances, while audio includes speech and singing across six languages. Unlike existing controlled-environment datasets, it enables evaluation under complex, realistic conditions, as detailed in Sec. H. 

Evaluation metrics. We evaluate generation quality using PSNR, SSIM, Fr´ echet Inception Distance (FID) for spatial quality, and Fr´ echet Video Distance (FVD) for temporal consistency. Lip-sync quality is measured by landmark distance (LMD) and SyncNet confidence (Sync-C). Identity preser-vation is assessed through cosine similarity of ArcFace embeddings (CSIM), CLIP score (CLIPS) for semantic features, and LPIPS for perceptual similarity. For the more challenging ContextDubBench, we additionally report no-reference perceptual qual-ity metrics, including Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE), Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE), and HyperIQA (Su et al., 2020). We also report the overall suc-cess rate across all 440 video samples, with failed or entirely unsynchronized generations manually excluded. This metric is crucial for practical dubbing scenarios, as traditional methods often fail completely under visual challenges like stylized characters, occlusions, or extreme poses. 7Can /kæn / You /ju ː/ Way /weɪ / Among /əˈ mʌŋ / Villa ge /ˈ vɪlɪ dʒ / Whi ch /wɪ tʃ / Shou ld /ʃʊ d/ How /haʊ / [Silent] Audio

We evaluate our editor on both HDTF (Zhang et al., 2021) and ContextDubBench, comparing against state-of-the-art methods including Wav2Lip (Prajwal et al., 2020), VideoReTalking (Cheng et al., 2022), TalkLip (Wang et al., 2023), IP-LAP (Zhong et al., 2023), Diff2Lip (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2024), MuseTalk (Zhang et al., 2024), and LatentSync (Li et al., 2024). We also re-implement a generalizable variant of our generator , denoted as generator ∗, by removing data-creation-specific 8constraints and aligning its setup with the editor . This allows a fair comparison between traditional inpainting and our context-rich editing dubbing, isolating paradigm gains from backbone capacity. Quantitative results in Tab. 1 and 2 show that our editor sets a new state of the art. On HDTF, it achieves superior visual quality (FID –12.6%, FVD –25.0%), stronger lip sync (Sync-C +4.9%), and improved identity retention (CSIM +4.3%) over the best prior method. On the more challenging ContextDubBench, the advantages are even more pronounced: our model delivers better visual qual-ity (NIQE 5.78 vs 6.11, BRISQUE 29.9 vs 39.2), higher lip–audio consistency (Sync-C +16.0%), and stronger identity preservation (CSIM +6.1%). Remarkably, it attains a success rate of 96.4%, exceeding the strongest baseline by over 24 points, while most prior methods remain around only 60–70%. This large margin underscores the robustness and practical reliability of our approach in diverse and unconstrained scenarios, as the paired contextual inputs supply complete identity and spatiotemporal cues that allow the model to generalize beyond controlled settings. Interestingly, our generator ∗ already surpasses prior methods on HDTF, with clear gains in identity preservation (CLIPS +1.7%) and visual quality (FVD –26.8%). This highlights the strong gen-erative capacity of the DiT backbone and its potential as a contextual synthesizer under tailored principles. More importantly, when trained on synthetic contextual pairs, our editor achieves further improvements (CSIM +3.3%, Sync-C +6.4%, and LPIPS –22.2%) while maintaining comparable FVD. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our self-bootstrapping paradigm: the backbone not only generates paired data but also benefits from it, enabling stronger mask-free dubbing. To further examine the self-bootstrapping effect, we evaluate the generator tailored for data con-struction. We sampled 20 synthetic pairs unseen during editor training, compared with the editor’s outputs from the same inputs. As shown in Tab. 4, the editor consistently outperforms the con-structed pairs in lip sync and visual quality. Notably, it even achieves stronger identity consistency than the training pairs. We attribute this to the fact that slight mismatches in synthetic companions, especially in fine-grained identity details, behave as speech-irrelevant noise that is suppressed dur-ing training. Meanwhile, the editor benefits far more from the rich, frame-aligned contextual signals than it is harmed by such noise, resulting in higher identity fidelity and stronger robustness. 4.2 QUALITATIVE EVALUATION 

Fig. 4 shows qualitative comparisons, where our method consistently produces realistic, lip-synced results across challenging scenarios. Traditional baselines often yield inaccurate lip shapes (Col. 1), visual artifacts (Col. 2), weak robustness to occlusion (Col. 5), and side-view distortions with iden-tity drift (Col. 2&9). Even our generator ∗, though using segmentation to handle occlusions, shows blur along mask boundaries and remains highly sensitive to mask accuracy. The rightmost column further reveals severe lip-shape leakage in all mask-based methods, where silent frames are cor-rupted by open-mouth artifacts. In contrast, our editor performs precise lip editing with faithful identity preservation and robustness to spatiotemporal dynamics (e.g., facial occlusions). More-over, unlike some mask-based methods that rely on human-face priors, such as landmarks and 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs), to obtain facial masks and thus often fail on stylized or non-human characters (marked “ERROR”), our method uses contextual cues to localize speech-relevant regions without mask heuristics, yielding stable performance across character types and occlusions. 

User study. We further conduct a user study with 30 participants on 24 dubbing videos from differ-ent methods, collecting Mean Opinion Scores (MOS). Each video is rated on a 5-point Likert scale for realism, lip sync, identity preservation, and overall quality. As shown in Tab. 3, our method holds clear margins over existing baselines across all aspects. Moreover, our editor surpasses generator ∗,particularly in identity consistency (4.40 vs. 4.02) and lip sync (4.50 vs. 3.87), validating the self-bootstrapping paradigm and yielding perceptually convincing, high-quality dubbing. 4.3 ABLATION STUDY 

We conduct ablations on two key components: 1) reference video injection mechanism, and 2) timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy, with results in Tab. 5 and visualization in Fig. 5. For reference conditioning, replacing our frame-level token concatenation with channel concatena-tion causes a clear drop in lip sync (Sync-C –12.5%), which is also visible as lip-shape error in 9w/o Lip Tuning Ours w/ Token Concat (Ours )w/ Channel Concat

Figure 5: Ablations on reference video conditioning and multi-phase learning. Replacing our 

frame-wise token-sequence concatenation (abbr. concat) with channel concat for reference con-ditioning causes conflicts and thus lowers lip-sync accuracy. Removing the lip or texture phase degrades lip synchronization and detailed texture fidelity, respectively. Please üzoom in for details. Fig. 5. Channel concatenation enforces rigid spatial fusion that conflicts with lip editing, while our token-based design uses self-attention to transfer identity without disturbing lips. For training, replacing progressive multi-phase sampling with uniform timestep sampling, i.e., learn-ing all noise levels at once, causes severe degradation and even divergence. Stage-wise comparisons further show that removing the lip phase reduces lip sync (–10.3%), with negligible gains in FID and LPIPS, while removing the texture phase weakens fidelity and identity (CSIM –4.1%). These results confirm that the three phases are complementary: high-noise pretraining secures global struc-ture, mid-noise sharpens articulation, and low-noise restores textures and identity. Moreover, the progressive design eases contextual learning by allowing the model to address different information sequentially, rather than struggling with all aspects at once. 

## 5 CONCLUSION 

In this paper, we introduce a novel self-bootstrapping paradigm to address the core challenge in visual dubbing: the absence of paired real-world training data. We argue that instead of relying on masked inpainting, visual dubbing should be reframed as a well-conditioned video-to-video editing task. Built upon this paradigm, we present X-Dub , a context-rich dubbing framework, where a DiT model that first acts as a generator to create its own ideal training pairs with complete visual context, and then as an editor that learns from this curated data. This process is further refined by a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy that disentangles the learning of structure, lips, and texture, enhancing final output quality. Extensive experiments on standard datasets and our new challenging benchmark, ContextDubBench, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. X-Dub shows exceptional robustness in complex, in-the-wild scenarios, significantly outperforming prior works. We believe this work not only sets a new standard for visual dubbing but also offers a valuable insight for other conditional video editing tasks where paired data is scarce. ETHICS STATEMENT 

This work presents a self-bootstrapping paradigm for visual dubbing, enabling more accurate and identity-preserving lip synchronization. While such technology can benefit applications in accessi-bility, education, and multilingual content production, it also raises ethical concerns. In particular, the ability to realistically alter speech and lip movements may facilitate misuse, including the gen-eration of non-consensual content, impersonation, or misinformation. To mitigate these risks, we stress the importance of informed consent, respect for individual privacy, and transparent disclosure of synthetic media. Responsible deployment and adherence to ethical standards are crucial to ensure that advances in visual dubbing contribute positively to society.

A.1 PRELIMINARY OF FLOW -M ATCHING -B ASED DIT M ODELS 

We adopt a pre-trained T2V DiT model as the backbone for both stages (Hong et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2024; Wan et al., 2025). It follows a latent diffusion paradigm with a 3D causal Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) (Kingma & Welling, 2013) for video compression and a DiT (Peebles & Xie, 2023) for sequence modeling. Each DiT block interleaves 2D (spatial) self-attention, 3D (spatio-temporal) self-attention, text cross-attention, and feed-forward networks (FFN). Training follows standard flow matching (Esser et al., 2024; Lipman et al., 2022) with the forward process: 

zt = (1 − t) z0 + t ϵ, ϵ ∼ N (0 , I), (4) and a v-prediction objective to predict v = ϵ − z0 conditioned on c:

. (5) A.2 ADAPTATION OF TEXT CROSS -A TTENTION MECHANISM 

To effectively adapt the pre-trained backbone—originally designed for text-to-video generation—for the visual dubbing task, we implement a specific strategy for handling text cross-attention. During training, we utilize Qwen2.5-VL Bai et al. (2025) to generate coarse captions for the target real videos, which serves to preserve the backbone’s generative priors. However, to ensure the model primarily relies on the provided visual context and audio signals rather than textual descriptions, we apply a high dropout rate of 70% to these text conditions. Architecturally, the text embeddings inter-act exclusively with the noised target tokens via cross-attention, while the reference tokens remain unaffected. For inference, to maintain practical convenience without requiring user-provided cap-tions, we employ an empty string as the positive prompt. Additionally, we leverage Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with standard negative prompts (e.g., “Blurry, deformed, low quality, distorted...”) to suppress artifacts and ensure high-fidelity generation. A.3 DETAILS OF OUR MASK -B ASED GENERATOR 

Mask setting. Previous mask-based dubbing methods typically employ either half-face rectangular masks from smoothly varying bounding boxes Prajwal et al. (2020); Cheng et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023) or fixed irregular-shaped masks on affine-transformed facial crops Guan et al. (2023); Li et al. (2024). However, the former’s size variations often lead to lip motion infor-mation leakage, causing models to learn lip movements from visual occlusion changes rather than the conditional speech, resulting in shortcut learning. The latter constrains jaw position, disrupting pronounced mouth shapes such as wide-open expressions. Instead, we utilize frame-wise estimated 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) (Retsinas et al., 2024) to obtain full-face masks. Specifically, we maintain each frame’s pose, shape, and expression coeffi-cients unchanged except for the jaw opening parameter, which is fixed at a maximum opening value of 0.4. We then project the facial mesh to generate masks. This approach minimizes mask size leak-age caused by inter-frame lip variations while providing sufficient editable regions for unrestricted lip control. This strategy facilitates creating synthetic data with lip shapes distinct from the original video, aligning with our data construction principles. 

Audio conditioning. Audio features are extracted using the Whisper (Radford et al., 2023) encoder and then injected via an audio cross-attention layer placed after text cross-attention. Since visual tokens and audio features have different temporal resolutions (1 video token frame corresponds to 8 audio-feature frames, i.e., 1:8), for each video frame, we select the corresponding audio feature frames according to the timestamp, together with neighboring frames, forming a temporal window of size n = 16 . This yields audio tokens ha ∈ R(b×f )×n×c, while video tokens are reshaped into 

hV ∈ R(b×f )×(h′×w′)×c, where h′ × w′ denotes the visual spatial size after patchification. Frame-wise cross-attention is then performed between the two modalities, where video tokens serve as queries and audio tokens as keys and values. Formally,

(6) 14 Reference conditioning. The reference frame Iref is sampled from a different segment of the same video during training to prevent lip-shape leakage, while at inference from the target segment to provide visual cues under a similar head pose. A.4 DETAILS OF OUR CONTEXT -D RIVEN EDITOR 

3D Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE). 3D RoPE is adopted in 3D self-attention of the DiT backbone to distinguish spatial-temporal positions, which we keep unchanged for target tokens. For reference tokens, inspired by Tan et al. (2024), we adapt RoPE to be temporally-aligned but spatially-shifted. Specifically, a reference token located at (i, j, k ), where i, j, and k denote the height, width, and temporal indices, is mapped to (i + h′, j + w′, k ), with (h′, w ′, f ′) the spatial–temporal sizes after patchification. This design provides two benefits: (1) Temporal alignment enables frame-wise consistency preservation of dynamic attributes such as background and head poses; (2) Spatial shifting avoids direct overlap that could distort lip movements, and instead encourages the model to capture spatially misaligned yet correlated features like identity information. 

## B DETAILS OF DATA CONSTRUCTION STRATEGIES 

B.1 SHORT -T ERM SEGMENT PROCESSING 

During generator inference with a single reference frame, we observe that denoising a long clip of 77 frames (matching the setting used by the backbone and the editor ) in one pass causes noticeable texture and color drift in the tail frames relative to the first; the drift resets at the first frame of the next clip (see Fig. 6). Therefore, under a single-reference regime, we conclude that single-pass denoising over long clips is detrimental to identity preservation . We hypothesize two contributing factors: 1) the reference frame is anchored at the first position, so later frames become distant in the RoPE index space, amplifying identity drift; and 2) long clips naturally accumulate larger head motion and spatiotemporal changes, which a single reference frame cannot fully constrain.

Figure 6: Example of intra-segment identity drift. To mitigate this, when constructing contextual pairs with the generator, we adopt short-segment training and inference: we generate clips of 25 frames and bridge adjacent clips with 5 motion frames, then concatenate them to form videos longer than 77 frames for supervising the editor ,which is trained on 77-frame segments. This short-segment strategy enhances identity preservation, while any slight sacrifice in lip sync accuracy remains within our design guidelines, as shown in Tab. 6. 15 Table 6: Quantitative results between long-term and short-term processing.

To enhance the robustness of our generator against occlusions, namely, to maintain consistency with the original video’s occlusion patterns and thereby facilitate the editor’s ability to naturally inherit them, we introduce an occlusion-handling pipeline. First, a vision–language model (VLM) (Bai et al., 2025) is prompted per video with: “Does any object occlude the person’s face? If yes, output 

only a concise description of the object(s). If no, output nothing.” The returned object phrase(s) are then passed to SAM 2 (Ravi et al., 2024) to segment candidate occluders, yielding an occlusion mask Mocc . We apply a light manual screening step to remove severely erroneous segmentations. Finally, we compose the occlusion-aware mask with the original inpainting mask. Let Mface be the face mask (foreground 1, background 0), and Mocc the occluder mask (1 on occluding objects). The visible-face mask is 

Mvis = Mface ∧ ¬ Mocc ,

and the inpainting mask (where 0 indicates regions to inpaint in our implementation) is 

Minp = ¬Mvis = ¬Mface ∨ Mocc ,

where ∧, ∨, and ¬ denote logical AND, OR, and NOT, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 7, Minp 

excludes occluders while preserving non-occluded facial areas for inpainting. ¬𝑀 !"# $ 𝑀 %## 𝑀 &'(

Figure 7: Example of mask processing with occlusion handling. While our occlusion annotations can be incomplete or noisy, and using occlusion masks may intro-duce slight blur near mask boundaries and occasional lip degradation, as shown in the main text, the pipeline still supplies paired and coherent references that preserve the scene’s occlusion pat-terns. This supervision encourages the final editor to model occlusion–face interactions in context, enabling robust handling of occlusions without labor-intensive manual intervention. B.3 LIGHTING AUGMENTATION 

To enhance the robustness of our editor against challenging lighting conditions often encountered in real-world scenarios, we leverage an internal video relighting method to augment our paired train-ing data. As illustrated in Fig. 8, we apply identical relighting effects to both the original target video V and its synthetic companion V ′. This synchronized processing ensures that the gener-ated companion video continues to serve as a valid contextual reference, providing frame-aligned lighting cues that match the target. Our relighting strategy encompasses diverse configurations, in-cluding static illumination with varying chromaticities and intensities, as well as dynamic lighting effects. Specifically, to simulate complex environmental dynamics where the contextual input must provide time-varying illumination information, we introduce continuous variations in light source color, intensity, and direction across frames. To maintain high visual fidelity, we primarily apply 16 this augmentation to high-quality video data captured in controlled, uniformly-lit laboratory envi-ronments. Furthermore, to prevent potential artifacts introduced by the relighting process itself from negatively impacting the editor ’s training, we restrict this augmentation to a conservative fraction (∼5%) of the total training dataset. This strategy effectively improves the model’s generalization to in-the-wild lighting dynamics without compromising generation quality.

Figure 8: Visualizing the lighting augmentation strategy. We apply identical static and dynamic relighting effects (e.g., changing color, intensity, and direction) to both the generated contextual reference and the target video. This ensures the editor learns to utilize lighting cues from the context even under varying illumination conditions. B.4 POST -P ROCESSING 

Similar to Zhong et al. (2023), we use a Gaussian-smoothed face mask in post-processing to com-posite the generator’s facial region back onto the original frames, mitigating minor background and boundary artifacts. Concretely, we blur the binary face mask Mface with a Gaussian kernel to obtain 

˜Mface ∈ [0 , 1] , and perform per-frame alpha blending: 

Vpost = ˜Mface ⊙ Vgen +  1 − ˜Mface 

 ⊙ Vorig ,

where ⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication. This feathered composition keeps backgrounds con-sistent while preserving sharp facial edits, yielding training pairs with background-aligned context and helping the editor learn background-consistent editing behavior. B.5 QUALITY FILTERING 

To maintain identity consistency while enforcing distinct lip shapes, we apply two complemen-tary filters to each synthetic-original pair: 1) Identity similarity filter. We use ArcFace (Deng et al., 2019) to compute cosine similarity between the synthetic and original videos. As a reference, the mean within-speaker similarity across different real segments is 0.812, which is conservative given their differing head motions. Since our paired videos share identical head motion, we adopt a stricter threshold of 0.85 and discard pairs below this value to prevent identity drift. 2) Lip-shape distinction filter. After aligning faces to a canonical template using the Umeyama algorithm follow-ing Deng et al. (2019), we measure the landmark distance over the mouth region between the original and synthetic videos. To ensure sufficient lip-shape variation, we reject pairs with a mouth-region landmark distance below 1.0. To further safeguard visual quality and remove synthetic companions containing noticeable arti-facts, we additionally assess each generated clip using a multimodal video-quality model Han et al. (2025). Each video is rated on six aspects including image fidelity, aesthetic appeal, temporal sta-bility, motion smoothness, background consistency, and subject consistency, under a 5-point scoring 17 scheme where 1 means very poor while 5 means excellent. We compute the average score across all six dimensions for each clip and retain only those with a mean score above 4.0, ensuring that only high-quality, artifact-free companion videos are included in the final training set. B.6 3D T ALKING HEAD RENDERING DATA 

We leverage Unreal Engine to generate high-quality dubbing pairs. Initially, we acquire the 3D motion representation, which comprises ARKit-based facial expressions and 3D degree-of-freedom (3DOF) head poses. For each dataset entry containing speech audio and 3D motion representation 

(A, M ), we randomly select another entry (A′, M ′), and replace the speech-correlated coefficients in M with those from M ′ to form Mdub . Both the original dataset entry and its corresponding dubbed version are rendered as follows: 

V = R(A, M, I ),Vdub = R(A′, M dub , I ), (7) where R denotes the Unreal Engine rendering pipeline (following Chen et al. (2025)) and I repre-sents the Unreal Engine MetaHuman avatar. To ensure data diversity, we create multiple avatars; however, it is important to note that the same avatar is used for each individual dubbing pair. Ul-timately, we collect approximately 10 hours of 3D-rendered dubbing pairs in addition to the pairs generated by our DiT-based generator . These rendered pairs provide strictly aligned head motion, environment, and perfectly matched identity, which further enables the editor to focus on speech-related lip edits while preserving all other visual cues. Rendering examples are shown in Fig. 9. Original Dubbing

C.1 DERIVATION OF EQ. 3: T IMESTEP -C ONSTRAINED SINGLE -S TEP DENOISING 

Given the forward diffusion process as in Eq. 4 and the v-prediction objective v = ϵ − z0, we derive the single-step denoising formula for pixel-level supervision during training, avoiding excessive computational overhead. From Eq. 4, we can rearrange to obtain: 

z0 = zt − t ϵ

1 − t . (8) Since v = ϵ − z0, we have ϵ = v + z0. Substituting and solving for z0:

z0 = zt − t(v + z0)1 − t = zt − tv − tz0

1 − t

(1 − t)z0 = zt − tv − tz0

z0 = zt − tv.

During inference, we use the predicted velocity ˆv instead of the true v, yielding: 

ˆz0 = zt − tˆv. (10) Alternatively, we can express this as: 

ˆz0 = z0 + t(v − ˆv), (11) which shows the reconstruction error depends on the velocity prediction error scaled by t.However, when t approaches 1, the velocity prediction error (v − ˆv) can be amplified, leading to poor reconstructions that result in inaccurate lip sync loss and identity loss computations. To address this, we introduce a timestep constraint: 

ˆx0 = D(z0 + ( v − ˆv) · min {t, t thres }), (12) where D denotes the VAE decoder. Importantly, this clipping is applied only in the denoising com-putation, not to the actual timestep t used in the model’s forward pass. The model still operates with the original t value, enabling it to learn important structural and lip movement information in high-and mid-noise regions. We set tthres = 0 .6 in our experiments. C.2 SYNC NET SUPERVISION .For lip-sync tuning, we adopt a SyncNet (Chung & Zisserman, 2016) comprising a visual encoder 

SV and an audio encoder Sa to discriminate temporal alignment between video and audio clips. The lip-sync loss is defined as: 

Lsync = CosSim  SV ( ˆ x[f :f +8] 0 ), S a(a[f :f +8] ). (13) This loss is combined with LmFM defined in Eq. 1 in a weighted sum to train the lip-sync LoRA: 

Ltotal = (1 + w · M + wlip · Mlip ) ⊙ L FM + wsync · L sync . (14) C.3 DETAILS OF PARAMETER CHOICES FOR MULTI -P HASE LEARNING .Based on the well-established observation that diffusion models process information hierarchi-cally Peng et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2025); Meng et al. (2025), we first heuristically partition the noise schedule (timestep t) into three functional regions: high-noise for global structure, mid-noise for lip motion, and low-noise for detailed texture. This initial design is then finalized via the quantitative experiments. 

Determination of timestep shifting α for training. To determine the optimal α values that allow the editor to efficiently learn decoupled information in each phase, and also to maximize the im-pact of the lip-sync and identity losses without degrading overall quality, we conduct an ablation study on the specific α settings. The experiments for the mid- and low-noise phases are conducted sequentially, each building upon the optimal parameter choice from the preceding stage. 19 Table 8: Ablation study on the activation timestep ranges for LoRA experts during inference on the HDTF dataset. Bold indicates the best, while underline indicates the second best.

The results are presented in Tab. 7. For the high-noise phase focused on global structure, we find that performance is relatively insensitive to α values above 3.0, with the model stably converging to high visual quality with minimal changes in FID and LPIPS. This is consistent with findings in Esser et al. (2024). We finally select α = 5 .0 to minimize overlap with the mid-noise phase. For the mid-noise tuning phase, an overly large α (e.g., 3.0) degrades overall visual quality, while a low value (e.g., 0.8) diminishes the effectiveness of the lip-sync loss. The model’s performance is relatively stable within the intermediate range. We therefore select α = 1 .5 as the best balance between effective lip modification and preserving visual quality. Finally, for the low-noise phase, a larger α (e.g., 0.8) disrupts the previously learned lip shapes. Smaller values are more stable, and based on our results, we select α = 0 .2. This choice allows the texture tuning to maximize its enhancement of visual quality while minimizing any negative impact on the already-learned lip motion. 

Determination of timestep intervals for LoRA expert activation for inference. Similarly, we conduct an ablation study on the activation timestep ranges for the two trained LoRA experts during inference to determine the optimal phase boundaries. Note that this experiment uses the LoRA checkpoints trained with the optimal α values determined previously. The results are shown in Tab. 8. First, for both experts, naively activating them across the entire denoising process ( t ∈ [0 .0, 1.0] ) leads to a severe degradation in either visual quality or lip-sync, as this forces them to operate in timestep regions they rarely encountered during training. For the lip LoRA expert trained in the mid-noise phase, activating it too early ( t → 1) conflicts with global visual quality and causes flickering artifacts around the mouth. Activating it too late ( t → 0)fails to sufficiently enhance lip sync. For the texture LoRA expert trained in the low-noise phase, activating it too early degrades the quality of the lip motion. Therefore, to balance these trade-offs, we select the non-overlapping ranges of t ∈ [0 .4, 0.8] for the lip LoRA and t ∈ [0 .0, 0.3] for the texture LoRA. 

## D OTHER IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS 

We conduct experiments using a ∼1B-parameter T2V model on 32 GPUs, with face-centered videos at 512 × 512 resolution and 25 fps. For the generator , we conduct extended training for ∼15k steps on 600 hours of internet audio-video data, sampling 25 frames with lr=1e-5 and batch size 256, which takes ∼1 day. Using the trained generator , we then synthesize the contextual video pairs, a one-time data preparation step that takes ∼2 days. After inference and curation, we obtain 400 hours of video pairs, totaling 800 hours. For the editor , we begin with full-parameter training for ∼4k steps on 77-frame samples with lr=1e-5, batch size 256, and timestep shift α = 5 .0, followed by LoRA expert training for ∼1k steps each with lr=5e-6 and batch size 64; the entire training process for the 

editor takes ∼0.5 days. To reduce computational cost, we decode 4 tokens into 13-frame segments for pixel-level loss computation. Timestep shifts are set to α = 1 .5 for the lip expert and α = 0 .2

for the texture expert. Loss weights are set as w = wlip = 0 .3 for masks, and 0.05 for SyncNet, CLIP, and ArcFace loss. 20 E INFERENCE TIME AND COMPUTATIONAL COST 

Inference with our editor requires approximately 30 GB of VRAM and fits comfortably on a single GPU. With 50 denoising steps, the editor takes about 1 minute to process a 3-second, 25 fps video at 512 × 512 resolution. To provide a comprehensive performance profile, we compare our editor ’s inference time against some representative methods: a GAN-based dubbing model (Wav2Lip), a diffusion-based dubbing model (LatentSync), and a large-scale single-image animation model (MultiTalk). All diffusion-based methods are benchmarked with 50 denoising steps for a fair comparison, as shown in Tab. 9. Table 9: Inference time comparison on a single GPU. All diffusion models use 50 steps. The task is to process a 3-second, 25 fps video. Method Wav2Lip LatentSync MultiTalk Ours-editor             

> Model Type GAN Diffusion (UNet) Diffusion (DiT) Diffusion (DiT) Parameters ∼36M ∼816M ∼14B ∼1.5B Inference Time ∼1s ∼30s ∼1800s (30 min) ∼60s (1 min)

The results in Tab. 9 show a clear quality-efficiency trade-off. As expected, our editor is slower than lightweight GAN-based methods like Wav2Lip, but its inference speed is comparable to other diffusion-based dubbing methods such as LatentSync. Crucially, our method achieves this compa-rable speed while delivering substantially better lip-sync accuracy and visual quality. Furthermore, when compared to large-scale animation models, our 1.5B parameter editor achieves an overall quality comparable to the 14B MultiTalk model, yet requires only a fraction of its inference time and parameter size. This demonstrates that a task-specific design for visual dubbing is more cost-effective than simply scaling up to a much larger, general-purpose video generation backbone. Finally, our method can be significantly accelerated. Thanks to our context-rich editing formulation, the early, high-noise denoising steps primarily involve inheriting global structure from the input video. This allows us to safely reduce the number of denoising steps in this phase by approximately 10. Combined with lightweight acceleration techniques such as sequence parallelism and test-time caching ( e.g. , TeaCache Liu et al. (2024)), we can further shorten the inference time to approximately 25 seconds for a 3-second clip, without noticeable quality degradation. This substantially mitigates practical deployment limitations. 

## F ABLATION ON PARADIGM VS . T RAINING STRATEGY 

To clearly disentangle the contributions of our two core components—the self-bootstrapping paradigm (using constructed paired data) and the timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy— we conduct a crucial ablation study. We compare four settings, varying the paradigm (inpainting vs. editing) and the training strategy (single-phase vs. multi-phase). Table 10: Ablation study disentangling the contributions of the paradigm (inpainting vs. editing) and the training strategy (single-phase vs. multi-phase). Best results are in bold .

> ③editor Editing Single-Phase (Uniform) 18.52 0.125 7.68 Not converged.
> ④editor Editing Multi-Phase 7.03 0.014 8.56

The results in Tab. 10 lead to two key findings. First, the primary performance gain stems from the paradigm shift enabled by the constructed paired data. Applying multi-phase learning to the inpainting-based generator* (② vs. ①) yields negligible gains, and its performance remains far below that of our final editor (④). This demonstrates that the training strategy alone cannot overcome the fundamental limitations of the inpainting paradigm, which lacks frame-aligned visual context. 21 Second, the multi-phase learning strategy is an essential enabler for the editor , but not the genera-tor* . The generator* converges well with uniform sampling ( ①) as its inpainting task is straight-forward generation. The editor , in contrast, must balance the conflicting objectives of inheriting structure, editing lips, and preserving texture. A standard single-phase approach mixes these signals and causes training to collapse ( ③), whereas our multi-phase strategy disentangles them, enabling stable and effective training ( ④). In summary, the paradigm shift is the primary source of improve-ment, while the multi-phase learning strategy is a necessary mechanism that allows the editor to function reliably within this new paradigm.

## H CONTEXT DUB BENCH 

To thoroughly evaluate our framework, we construct ContextDubBench benchmark, a challenging benchmark comprising 440 video-audio pairs. The dataset is carefully designed with the following composition: 

Audio data. The audio component includes both speech and singing. For speech, we randomly sampled 350 clips from Common Voice (Ardila et al., 2019), spanning six languages and dialects: 170 in English, 60 in Mandarin, 30 in Cantonese, 30 in Japanese, 30 in Russian, and 30 in French. For singing, we incorporated 60 English clips from NUS-48E (Duan et al., 2013) and 30 Mandarin clips from Opencpop (Wang et al., 2022). Each segment lasts between 7 and 14 seconds and captures a wide range of speaking rates, pitch levels, accents, and vocal styles, ensuring rich phonetic and linguistic diversity. 22 Figure 11: ContextDubBench benchmark Examples (I): Showcasing non-human characters with diverse morphological variations. 

Video data. The video set combines real-world recordings and AI-generated content from publicly available sources with proper copyright clearance (e.g., Civitai, Mixkit, Pexels). It contains 291 clips of natural human subjects, 108 clips of stylized characters with distinct artistic features, and 41 clips of non-human or humanoid entities with durations ranging from 2 to 9 seconds. Representative samples are shown in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, and Fig. 13. Unlike conventional datasets, which are typi-cally captured under controlled conditions, ContextDubBench is explicitly designed to reflect real-world challenges. The dataset incorporates dynamic lighting, partial occlusions, identity-preserving transformations, and substantial variations in pose and motion. By embedding these factors, Con-textDubBench more faithfully captures the diversity and unpredictability of real-world scenarios, providing a rigorous testbed for evaluating lip-synchronization models. Illustrative examples are shown in Fig. 14. 23 Figure 12: ContextDubBench benchmark Examples (II): Showcasing stylized characters with dis-tinctive visual designs.
