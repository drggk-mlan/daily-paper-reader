## Abstract
An integer program is called ideal if its continuous relaxation coincides with its convex hull allowing the problem to be solved as a continuous program and offering substantial computational advantages. Proving idealness analytically can be extraordinarily tedious -- even for small formulations -- such proofs often span many pages of intricate case analysis which motivates the development of automated verification methods. We develop a general-purpose framework for certifying idealness in Mixed Binary Linear Programs (MBLPs), formulating the verification problem as a linear program when the data is fixed and as a nonconvex quadratic program when the data is parametric. We apply this framework to study several formulations of the rectangle packing problem that are conjectured to be pairwise-ideal, obtaining computational proofs where analytic proofs were previously unknown or impractical. As our second contribution, we introduce and model a novel generalization of the rectangle packing problem that enforces edge clearances between selected rectangles. We present both existing and novel MBLP formulations which arise from different encodings of the underlying disjunctive constraints. We perform some computational experiments on these formulations under a strip-packing objective to determine the importance of pairwise-idealness in practice.

## 摘要
如果一个整数规划的连续松弛与其凸包重合，则称其为理想的（ideal），这使得该问题可以作为连续规划来求解，并具有显著的计算优势。解析地证明理想性可能极其繁琐——即使对于小型公式也是如此——此类证明通常涉及长达数页的复杂案例分析，这促使了自动化验证方法的发展。我们开发了一个用于证明混合二元线性规划（MBLP）理想性的通用框架，当数据固定时，将验证问题建模为线性规划；当数据为参数化时
