## Abstract
Robots that follow natural-language instructions often either plan at a high level using hand-designed interfaces or rely on large end-to-end models that are difficult to deploy for real-time control. We propose TeNet (Text-to-Network), a framework for instantiating compact, task-specific robot policies directly from natural language descriptions. TeNet conditions a hypernetwork on text embeddings produced by a pretrained large language model (LLM) to generate a fully executable policy, which then operates solely on low-dimensional state inputs at high control frequencies. By using the language only once at the policy instantiation time, TeNet inherits the general knowledge and paraphrasing robustness of pretrained LLMs while remaining lightweight and efficient at execution time. To improve generalization, we optionally ground language in behavior during training by aligning text embeddings with demonstrated actions, while requiring no demonstrations at inference time. Experiments on MuJoCo and Meta-World benchmarks show that TeNet produces policies that are orders of magnitude smaller than sequence-based baselines, while achieving strong performance in both multi-task and meta-learning settings and supporting high-frequency control. These results show that text-conditioned hypernetworks offer a practical way to build compact, language-driven controllers for ressource-constrained robot control tasks with real-time requirements.
