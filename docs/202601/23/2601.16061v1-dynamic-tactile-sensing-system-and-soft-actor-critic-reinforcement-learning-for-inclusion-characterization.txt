Abstract — This paper presents the Dynamic Tactile Sensing System that utilizes robotic tactile sensing in 

conjunction with reinforcement learning to locate and characterize embedded inclusions. A dual arm robot is 

integrated with an optical Tactile Imaging Sensor that utilizes the Soft Actor Critic Algorithm to acquire tactile data 

based on a pixel intensity reward. A Dynamic Interrogation procedure for tactile exploration is developed that enables 

the robot to first localize inclusion and refine their positions for precise imaging. Experimental validation conducted 

on Polydimethylsiloxane phantoms demonstrates that the robot using the Tactile S oft Actor Critic Model was able to 

achieve size estimation errors of 2. 61 % and 5. 29 % for soft and hard inclusions compared to 7. 84 % and 6.87 % for expert 

human operators . Results also show that Dynamic Tactile Sensing System was able to locate embedded inclusions 

and autonomously determine their mechanical properties , useful in applications such as breast tumor 

characterization.

I.  INTRODUCTION 

actile sensing estimates mechanical properties such as size 

and elasticity of a n object [1] . Dy namic tactile sensing 

extends this capability by capturing tactile information during 

motion for the perception of high spatial and temporal 

frequencies [2] . In contrast to static sensing, the dynamic 

motion of tactile sensors enhances sensitivity to reveal 

mechanical features that may otherwise remain undetected [2] .

Dynamic tactile sensing has been applied across a diverse set of 

sensing tasks such as perception of liquid containers , fine 

surface features , and objects [2], [3], [4] . More recently, a

Bayesian embedded object detection mapping method was 

reported in [5] . We extend this line of research by 

autonomously characterizing embedded inclusions . Our work 

aims to leverage dynamic tactile sensing for inclusion 

characterization with applications in breast tumor 

characterization. 

Accurate b reast tumor characterization is essential , as breast 

cancer is leading cause of death among women , and early 

detection can improve patient outlook [6], [7] . However, 

traditional screening modalities such as an MRI or 

mammography require specialized hospital settings and trained 

personnel, limiting their deployment in non -clinical 

environments. Moreover, the pain and discomfort associated 

with these methods are well documented and may lead to 

patients forgoing future examinations [8], [9] . A patient -

friendly alternative we propose is t he use of an autonomous 

robot to perform dynamic tactile sensing for breast tumor 

characterization . This would avoid MRI -related claustrophobia 

and reduce discomfort through precise force control compared 

to mammographic compression. Furthermore, surveys of 

automated robotic breast -exam systems have reported high 

patient acceptability and willingness to undergo robotic 

examination [10] . These considerations motivate the 

development of an autonomous robotic control framework that 

is capable of dynamic tactile sensing .

Dynamic tactile sensing in robots can be accomplished using 

reinforcement learning (RL), an artificial intelligence (AI) 

computational approach , where an agent learns by directly 

interacting with its environment [11], [12] . A key advantage of 

RL is that it does not require a predefined model of the 

environment, making it well suited for complex environments 

where a model is not known beforehand. RL algorithms 

maximize cumulative rewards, enabling agents to 

autonomously determine optimal actions through trial -and -

error exploration [12] . Recent advances in RL have led to 

significant improvements in various applications such as 

gaming, robotic control, and computer vision [12], [13], [14] .

Robotic tactile RL has been used in applications such as 

teach ing a robot to flip through the pages of a book and 

ultrasound probe positing towards a target region [15] , [16] .

Other robotic systems have performed ultrasound and tactile 

characterization for vertebrae target loca lization through force

# Tfeedback , though RL was not used for control [17] . The 

previously mentioned works use RL for trajectory optimization; 

however , they do not use RL for tactile imaging of inclusions 

or characterizing the target’s mechanical properties . Previous 

work in our lab on dynamic sensing focused on inclusion size 

and depth estimation , using diffuse optical methods [18], [19] .

However, our prior dynamic sensing did not use RL and was 

not applied to tactile sensing. Building on our previous work, 

we extend the dynamic sensing method by integrating RL and 

tactile sensing to characterize the location and mechanical 

properties of inclusions. 

For our RL application, we propose to use the soft actor 

critic (SAC) algorithm to t rain a dual -arm robot (Baxter) to 

perform tactile sensing autonomously. SAC has been shown to 

provide stable learning and reliable performance for robotic 

trajectory control and path planning [16], [20] . SAC also 

leverages the benefits of sample -efficient off -policy learning 

while improving stability and convergence through the use of a 

maximum entropy framework ; which reduces real time training 

and wear and tear on hardware [21] . This makes it suitable for 

robotic hardware implementation , where training time and 

mechanical stress warrant consideration. This is relevant for the 

use of tactile sensors, where significant repeated use may cause 

damage to the sensor. Thus , in this paper we introduce our 

Dynamic Tactile Sensing System (DTSS) that autonomously 

locates and estimates the mechanical properties of a target 

inclusion in a given region of interest (ROI) using a robotic arm 

and a trained tactile SAC model .

II. DYNAMIC TACTILE SENSING USING SAC RL 

This section introduces o ur DTSS that enables dynamic and 

autonomous interrogation of a ROI to locate and characterize 

embedded inclusions. The DTSS hardware co nsists of three 

components: a robot, the Tactile Imaging Sensor (T IS) (a tactile 

sensing device used in our lab’s previous works [1], [18], [22] ), 

and a laptop . The DTSS software consists of mechanical 

property computation software, robot firmware for control, and 

the algorithms developed and used in this paper .

The following subsections outline the principle of our TIS, 

the SAC -based control formulation, and the training and testing 

framework for the DTSS . We begin by describing the TIS,

which forms the foundation of our proposed DTSS .

A. Tactile Imaging Sensor 

The TIS uses an optical method to collect tactile images 

which are converted into mechanical properties [1] . The T IS

operates based on the principle of total internal reflection of 

light in a soft transparent Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) 

sensing probe. When an object deforms the probe, the light is 

scattered and captured by a CMOS camera (UI -3240CP -NIR ,

IDS Imaging Development Systems GmbH, Obersulm, 

Germany ), creating a tactile image of the object [18], [22] . A 

force sensor (TE FX29, TE Connectivity, USA), with a range 

of 0 to 50 N, simultaneously records the applied normal force 

for each tactile image . Prior work [17], [21] relied on a trained 

human operator to apply a gradually increasing , vertical ,

normal force to obtain accurate results . Our D TSS use s RL and 

a robot to automate this process. 

In RL, the main objective is to determine a policy which 

maximizes the expected sum of rewards [12], [22] . Among the 

many RL methods used for robotics, we adopt the SAC for its 

off -policy experience reuse, robustness , and strong sample 

efficiency in continuous space . This r educes training time and 

mechanical wear during learning [21], [23] . Therefore, the SAC 

algorithm is well suited for our DTSS . As required by SAC, we 

next define the state, action space, and reward for our system. 

B. Soft Actor Critic : State, Action Space , and Reward 

The objective of our RL training is to teach a robot to take 

tactile data of unseen objects by using the SAC algorithm to 

maximize the reward derived from the tactile images . Thus, the 

robot’s states, actions, and rewards must be defined before we 

can implement it . The robot’s state is defined as the position of 

the end effector in robot ’s base frame and the action space 

consist s of two movements in the Z -direction, either up or down 

by a fixed step . We only use the Z -direction as the T IS needs to 

have steady applied force in a vertically normal direction to 

operate properly. The reward is the sum of pixel intensity values 

in each tactile image, which increases when the probe deforms 

over an inclusion, thereby reinforcing the sensing behavior [1], 

[18], [22] . With the states, action space, and reward defined, we 

can now detail our training framework to utilize SAC. In order 

to implement this SAC algorithm on a robot, we need to train 

and test the Tactile SAC Model. 

C. Training of Tactile S AC Model 

To implement the SAC algorithm on a robot , the following 

set up for training was developed as shown in Fig . 1. The Tactile 

SAC Model training framework comprises the robot, the T IS,

and a laptop. The laptop handles communication and training 

of the DTSS through three main scripts: the main server script ,

the training script , and the environment script. Here, the TIS

continuously transmits tactile data (the applied force and tactile 

images ) to the main server script . In addition, t he robot provides 

the current end effector position associated with each tactile 

image.    

> Fig. 1. Tactile S AC Model Training Framework

The main server script (Python 2.7) processes the tactile 

images to compute the sum of pixel intensities and 

communicates bidirectionally over a socket connection with the 

Training Script (Python 3.5). This socket connection bridge s

the limitations of our robot’s software development kit 

requiring Python 2.7 and our desire to use SAC RL libraries in 

Python 3. The training script loads the environment from the 

environment script , implements the SAC RL using Stable 

Baselines , and generates robot actions based on the learned 

policy [24], [25] . The environment script defines the custom 

Gym environment , including initialization, reset, step, and state retrieval functions, where the reward corresponds to the sum of 

pixel intensity and the state is the end effector position [25] .

Upon completion of training, the Tactile SAC Model is saved 

in the training script’s file directory. To utilize our Tactile SAC 

Model on our robot, we test our model using the following 

testing setup. 

D. Testing of Tactile S AC Model 

The testing setup , illustrated in Fig. 2, consists of the same 

robot, TIS, and laptop used in the training setup. The laptop 

communicates with the system and tests the model using four 

scripts: the main server script, the testing script, the 

environment script, and the camera server script. The main and 

environment script s operate identically to those in the training 

framework. The testing script initializes the end effector 

position by a manually entered starting position and then 

queries the Tactile SAC M odel from the training framework to 

generate an action . This action is transmitted to the main server, 

wh ich sends the corresponding command to the robot . The 

robot execute s the action and returns its updated current end 

effector position to the main script which relays it back to the 

testing script for further control cycles . During operation, the 

testing script send s the current end effector position and applied 

force to the camera server script and the T IS begins recording 

tactile data when the applied force is within a predetermined 

force range. The T IS then saves all tactile images to the laptop 

for post processing and analysis.     

> Fig. 2.Tactile S AC Model Testing Framework

The SAC RL testing framework provides the infrastructure 

for model execution and tactile data collection using the T IS

with our robotic arm given a manual initial position . With a 

Tactile SAC Model, we will be able to dynamically sense 

inclusion s using a robot manipulator. However, we must also 

be able to locate the inclusions without prior knowledge to 

utilize our Tactile SAC model . Therefore, in the next section, 

we introduce our Dynamic Interrogation algorithm that locates 

inclusions for a given region. 

III. DYNAMIC INTERROGATION TO FIND TARGET LOCATION 

To determine the mechanical properties of inclusions, we 

first need to determine their location and quantity . Thus, we 

employ tactile exploration to extract relevant information of 

unknown object s through touch sensation [11] . This can be 

accomplished through tactile exploration procedures such as 

planned lateral movements and contour following [11], [26] .

Thus, we introduce our method of Dynamic Interrogation as an 

exploration procedure to determine inclusion locations. This 

method utilize s dynamic tactile sensing with our dual arm robot 

alongside the DTSS and is split in to two phases: Coarse 

Interrogation (CI) and Fine Interrogation (FI). 

A. Coarse Interrogation (CI) 

The CI’s objective is to collect tactile data over a defined 

ROI and return the location and number of possible inclusions .

The CI algorithm visit s specified locations in the ROI, 

illustrated as the “x” marked locations in Fig. 3 , for our 

application example . Before we conduct CI , we must first 

define a ROI that we wish to interrogate. To define the ROI, we 

define a two -dimensional rectangular region with dimensions, 

𝑅 𝑥  and  𝑅 𝑦 , in mm with a coordinate origin, (𝑥 0, 𝑦 0, 𝑧 0), as seen 

in the bottom right corner in Fig. 3. Once the ROI has been 

determined we can select the starting point,  (𝑥 𝑠 , 𝑦 𝑠 , 𝑧 𝑠 ), where 

the CI will begin. In our specific application , the ROI is 

contained within a glass dish ; therefore, to avoid possible 

collisions between the TIS and ROI boundary , we set the 

starting position well within the ROI. However, in other sensing 

settings, the starting position may be considered the same as the 

ROI origin.     

> Fig. 3.Coarse Interrogation Application ROI

In Fig. 3. The “ x” mark ed locations are evenly spaced in 

increments of ΔX and ΔY along the X and Y axes , respectively. 

These increments are determined by the footprint of the T IS and 

its sensing window. The CI algorithm begins by visiting the 

starting point and acquiring tactile data using TIS. The T IS then 

advances by ΔY to the next “x” location in the +Y direction and 

collects data . This is repeated until each location in the row has 

been visited, and data has been collected. Once every “ x” has 

been visited in the row, the system increments by ΔX to the next 

row and repositions itself to the rightmost location in that ro w. 

The row scanning process is repeated for that row. This process 

is repeated until all target locations in the ROI are visited and 

imaged. 

After the data is collected from each imaging location, we 

apply post -processing to remove noise and determine images 

that contain possible inclusions using region detection 

functions. We apply a predetermined diameter threshold and 

any region larger than this is treated as a potential inclusion .

The ROI coordinate locations and associated robot end effector 

locations of these possible inclusion locations are then saved to 

be further investigated by the fine interrogation algorithm. B. Fine Interrogation (FI) 

In the FI stage, the objective is to refine the locations of the 

inclusions found by the CI algorithm to more precisely 

determine the position and number of inclusions. T he FI 

algorithm sequentially visit s each location identified in the CI 

using the T IS and captures a tactile image under a constant 

specified applied force . For each image, the pixel centroid of 

the largest region is i dentified and the pixel offset between this 

centroid and the pixel image center along the X and Y direction 

is calculated. Th e T IS is then retracted and centered to this new 

centroid , and the process is repeated until the pixel offse t

between the tactile image centroid and image center falls below 

a predefined threshold . This final position is recorded as the 

estimated inclusion center. 

After all CI locations have been processed through the FI, 

we analyze the spatial correspondence between them. We 

consider inclusions separated by less than a predefined distance 

threshold to be treated as the same inclusion. If the distance is 

greater than this threshold between two inclusions, they are 

treated as distinct inclusions. After we have identified all the 

unique inclusion centers, we apply our SAC tactile sensing 

model to image each locatio n for detailed tactile imaging. 

IV. SYSTEM APPLICATION : BREAST TUMOR 

CHARACTERIZATION 

Our application in this paper is motivated by breast tumor 

characterization, specifically to locate and determine the 

mechanical properties of embedded tumors. Mechanical 

propert y estimation is important for tumor characterization as 

properties , such as size and stiffness , serve as biomarker s for 

breast tumor pre -screening. Cancerous tissues , in particular, 

exhibit higher stiffness than benign tissue [22] . Previously in 

our lab , we developed a classification metric called the Risk 

Score that considers mechanical properties such as stiffness and 

size to classify benign and malignant [22] . The Risk Score is 

computed through analysis of the tactile images generated by 

the DTSS. 

For our application, our DTSS is applied to dynamically 

sense and characterize embedded inclusions with in PDMS 

phantoms that mimic the mechanical properties of breast tissue .

The inclusions embedded in the phantoms are also made from 

PDMS a nd mimic the mechanical properties of tumors. The 

robot we use in our application is Baxter , a collaborative robot 

(cobot) specifically used for use with human interactions .

Baxter uses compliant joints for safe interaction with human 

operators thus making it suitable for our application [27] . To 

utilize DTSS , we first trained our Tactile SAC model and 

validated it against tactile imaging done by human operators. 

From these tactile images, we estimate the mechanical 

properties of the inclusion .

A. Mechanical Property Estimation 

We estimate the size and deformation index as the 

mechanical properties, which are used to determine a Risk 

Score . This is important for tumor characterization application 

as malignant and benign tumors exhibit differences in 

mechanical properties, including size and stiffness [22] .

1) Tactile Size Estimation 

We estimate the inclusion size from the tactile data captured 

by our T IS. This data is preprocessed to filter out noise by 

applying a median filter [22] . These images are further 

processed to estimate the inclusion size,  𝐷 , following the 

method described in [22] . This method uses a 3D interpolation 

model utilizing the sum of pixel intensity,  𝐼 𝑝 , of each image and 

the associated applied force,  𝐹 , and the modeled surface,  𝑝 𝑖 ,𝑗 ,

to determine the size as:  𝐷 (𝐹 , 𝐼 𝑝 ) = ∑𝑖 =𝑛  

> 𝑖 =0

∑𝑗 =𝑚  

> 𝑗 =0

𝑝 𝑖 ,𝑗 𝐹 𝑖 𝐼 𝑝 

> 𝑗

. Here, 

we modeled a third -order poly nomial surface with indices  𝑛 =

2 and  𝑚 = 1.

2) Tactile Deformation Index Estimation 

Under the same size, depth, and applied force conditions, 

stiffer inclusions cause greater deformation of the TIS probe 

than the softer ones. This surface deformation is quantified by 

the Deformation Index (DI), defined as the slope of the graph 

plotted with sum of the change in pixel intensity versus the 

change in applied force defined as:  𝐷 𝐼 𝑖 = ∑ ∑ 𝛥 𝑛  

> 𝑘 =1
> 𝑚
> 𝑙 =1𝐼 𝑖
> 𝑙 ,𝑘
> 𝛥 𝐹 𝑖

, w here 

𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, ⋯ . The change in the sum of pixel intensity,  𝛥 𝐼 𝑖 ,

and change in force,  𝛥 𝐹 𝑖 , of every  𝑖 𝑡 ℎ image is estimated with 

respect to a reference image [22] .

3) Tactile Risk Score Estimation 

We estimate risk score, a unitless value, to classify an 

inclusion as more benign or malignant. This score is derived 

from the estimated  𝐷𝐼  and the size,  𝐷 , of the embedded 

inclusion, following the method described in [22] . In this study, 

the score ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 indicating a n inclusion 

that is closer to malignant and 0 indicating that it is closer to 

benign . We define Risk Score as: 

𝑅𝑖𝑠𝑘 𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒 = [(𝑊 1 × 𝐷 

𝐷 max 

− 𝑊 2 × 𝐷𝐼 

𝐷 𝐼 max 

)].

Where  𝑊 1 and  𝑊 2 are weights for the size and  𝐷𝐼 . 𝐷 max  and 

𝐷 𝐼 max  are the maximum estimated size and maximum  𝐷𝐼 ,

respectively [22] .

B. SAC RL Validation Experiment 

The Tactile SAC Model was trained using the DTSS which 

consisted of the T IS mounted to the end effector of our Baxter ’s 

left arm. A PDMS phantom with an embedded inclusion was 

placed underneath the TIS for imaging. The overview of the 

complete system and the PDMS phantom setup is given in Fig .

4. The Tactile SAC Model was trained following the training 

framework described in Section III. 

To validate our Tactile SAC Model, we compare d the data 

collected from the model to the tactile data collected manually 

by human operator s under the same conditions. The manual 

data were collected by two operators who have expert level 

training and experience with the hand ling of the TIS.Fig. 4. SAC Tactile Sensing Validation .

C. Results of SAC Model Validation 

We tested the Tactile SAC model on t wo inclusion cases: 

hard (18.9 mm) inclusion with a stiffness of 628 kPa and soft 

(15.3 mm) inclusion with a stiffness of 94.4 kPa using the setup 

in Fig. 4 over an applied force range of 0 to 10 N. We 

summarized the size, DI, and Risk Score estimation results for 

the soft and hard inclusions for the manually taken data and the 

Tactile SAC Model data in Tables I and II , respectively .

The size estimation error obtained with our proposed Tactile 

SAC Model is lower for both the hard and soft inclusions than 

that of the human operator, 2. 61 % vs. 7. 84 % for the soft 

inclusions and 5. 29% vs. 7. 84 % for the hard inclusions. T he  𝐷𝐼 

ratio , defined as the ratio between the DI for the hard and soft 

cases , was computed as 1.04 for the manually acquired data and 

2.77 for the Tactile SAC Model . Thus, the DI ratio for the 

Tactile SAC Model is larger, indicating a greater distinction 

between soft (benign) and hard (malignant) inclusions than the 

manually acquired data . The Risk Score for each method 

indicates that the harder inclusion (with higher kPa ) is more 

malignant , as expected . However, the manually acquired data 

yields higher risk scores for both soft and hard inclusions 

compared to those produced by the Tactile SAC Model . The 

difference in DI and Risk Score between manual measurements 

and the Tactile SAC Model data is explained by the difference 

in how force was applied to the TI S. During Baxter data 

collection , force was exerted directly onto the top force sensor, 

while in manual data collection the T IS was held from the side, 

resulting in a different force distribution. Overall, the 

experimental results show that our proposed Tactile SAC 

Model produced better size estimation and distinction between 

soft and hard inclusions. Thus, our Tactile SAC model was 

deemed suitable for use in our DT SS , and we then applied our 

Dynamic Interrogation to an ROI with two unknown inclusions. 

We next describe the CI setup. 

D. Coarse Interrogation Setup 

For our CI setup, we used a new rectangular PDMS 

phantom with the dimensions of  𝑅 𝑥 = 165.1 mm and  𝑅 𝑦 =

215.9 mm that contain ed two embedded inclusions. The 

phantom was opaque , made in a similar fashion to the one in 

Fig. 4 and was placed in a glass dish. However, the phantom 

had a larger in clusion layer (12 mm depth ) th an the one used in 

Fig . 4. In this case we embedded one hard inclusion and one 

soft inclusion , with the same size and stiffness as the ones used 

in our Tactile SAC Model validation experimen t, in the 

in clusion layer. We define d the origin of the ROI in the Baxter 

base frame as: (0.6762, -0.1431, 0.1729). The starting location 

was defined in the ROI coordinate system as  (𝑥 𝑠 , 𝑦 𝑠 , 𝑧 𝑠 ) =

(38.25, 38.25, 25). The true center of the hard and the soft 

inclusion were at (44.50, 51 .50 , -6) and (40.00, 118.50, -6) ,

respectively , in the ROI coordinate system. Inclusions are 

indicated by the dark gray and white circles in Fig. 3. 

E. Coarse Interrogation Results 

The results of the CI returned three locations with the 

following XY ROI coordinates: Location 1 (38.25, 53.25), 

Location 2 (38.25, 68.25), and Location 3 (38.25, 113.25). Our 

CI returned three inclusions , whereas the true number of 

inclusions is two. This is attributed to a single inclusion being 

present across multiple tactile images . Thus, with these three 

inclusions, we will interrogate each one using the FI algorithm .

F. Fine Interrogation Setup 

For the FI setup, we interrogate each of the three locations 

found by the CI and determine three corresponding more 

precise locations of the inclusions. The pixel offset selected 

threshold was set to 70 pixels, or 2.1 mm in distance for our 

DTSS camera set up . The resulting XY locations are as follows 

in ROI coordinate system: Location 1 (38.20, 62.00), Location 

2 (44.00, 62.40), and Location 3 (44.00, 125 .00 ). 

The XY distances between Location 1 and Location 2 were 

found to be 5.8 mm, and thus below 6 mm so we consider this 

to be in the same location. This is because Baxter has a 

positional tolerance of  ±5.00 mm, so we wish to have locations 

within 1 .00 mm to be considered the same location, thus 6 .00 

mm. Thus, we selected Location 2 and Location 3 as the final 

locations of the inclusion, giving us two inclusions. It is 

important to note Location 2 was selected arbitrarily over 

Location 1, as they both considered the same point. The 

resulting distance between the true center of the hard and soft 

inclusion was calculated as 1 0.9 mm and 7.63 mm. The error in 

the resulting distance can be explained by the positional noise 

of the Baxter robot and the pixel threshold that was selected. 

Co mbining the 5 .00 mm positional tolerance of the Baxter and 

the 2.1 0 mm positional threshold for the FI, we would have a 

total of around 7.1 0 mm of error resulting for the system itself. 

With the location and number of inclusions found, we then 

applied our Tactile SAC Model to image the possible 

inclusions. G. Fine Interrogation Results 

For the two points considered, the Tactile SAC Model took 

tactile images, and the mechanical properties were estimated .

The size, DI, and R isk Score for Target Location s 3 and 2 are 

found in Table III. 

TABLE III. SIZE , DI, RISK SCORE (F INE INTERROGATION )

Reviewing Table III., t he size estimation error was slightly 

larger for the hard inclusion than for the soft inclusion. The 

increased error for the hard inclusion may be attributed to the 

increased depth of in clusion layer in the PDMS phantom. The 

DI ratio , however, was found to be 2.55, which is like DI ratio 

used in the Tactile SAC model validation experiment. The Risk 

Score also indicates that the hard inclusion is more malignant 

than the soft inclusion , as expected , and similarly is consistent 

with the results found in Table II. 

V. CONCLUSION 

We developed a Dynamic Tactile Sensing System that 

autonomously locates and senses the mechanical properties of 

unknown inclusions using a robotic arm and a trained SAC RL 

model . A Dynamic Interrogation algorithm was developed that 

uses a coarse and fine interrogation to precisely determine the 

number and location of unknown embedded inclusions. A 

Tactile SAC model was also developed and trained to mimic 

human like tactile sensing using a dual arm robot with pixel 

intensity as a reward . Validation e xperimental results show that 

our proposed Dynamic Tactile Sensing System provides better 

size estimation when compared to manual human operation. We 

conclude that our proposed Tactile SAC model algorithm can 

effectively be applied to tactile sensing for inclusion 

characterization . Our current work shows that ou r Dynamic 

Tactile Sensing System is able to autonomously locate and 

estimate the mechanical properties of inclusions better than an 

human operator.
