Abstract 

Motif discovery is a core problem in computational biology, tradi-tionally formulated as a likelihood optimization task that returns a single dominant motif from a DNA sequence dataset. However, regulatory sequence data admit multiple plausible motif explana-tions, reflecting underlying biological heterogeneity. In this work, we frame motif discovery as a quality-diversity problem and ap-ply the MAP-Elites algorithm to evolve position weight matrix motifs under a likelihood-based fitness objective while explicitly preserving diversity across biologically meaningful dimensions. We evaluate MAP-Elites using three complementary behavioral characterizations that capture trade-offs between motif specificity, compositional structure, coverage, and robustness. Experiments on human CTCF liver ChIP-seq data aligned to the human reference genome compare MAP-Elites against a standard motif discovery tool, MEME, under matched evaluation criteria across stratified dataset subsets. Results show that MAP-Elites recovers multiple high-quality motif variants with fitness comparable to MEME’s strongest solutions while revealing structured diversity obscured by single-solution approaches.

1 Introduction 

DNA sequence motif discovery is a central problem in biology, where the goal is to identify short sequence patterns associated with functional roles such as transcription factor binding, splicing, or regulation [ 13 ]. Accurate motif identification is valuable for the interpretation of high-throughput sequencing assays, including ChIP-seq, and is essential for understanding gene regulation [10]. Most classical motif discovery methods formulate the problem as a likelihood-based optimization task, seeking a single motif model that best explains the observed data. Representative methods, such as Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation (MEME), which are highly effec-tive but inherently designed to return only one or a small number of dominant motifs [ 1 , 7]. From a biological perspective, regulatory sequence data often exhibit heterogeneity: binding sites vary in specificity, degeneracy, and prevalence, and multiple motif variants may coexist within the same dataset [ 5 , 13 ]. ChIP-seq studies have shown that combinatorial and context-dependent binding gives

rise to multiple functional motif configurations rather than a single dominant pattern [ 2], motivating approaches that move beyond single optimal motifs. Evolutionary computation has been applied to DNA motif dis-covery, demonstrating that population-based stochastic search pro-vides an alternative to probabilistic optimization [ 3, 12 ]. These ap-proaches typically retain the objective structure of classical meth-ods, converging toward a single best motif under a predefined fitness criterion [ 6]. In this work, we frame motif discovery as a quality-diversity (QD) problem, aiming to discover diverse sets of high-quality motifs rather than a single optimal solution [11]. We use MAP-Elites to evolve position weight matrix (PWM) motifs under a likelihood-based fitness while preserving diver-sity across biologically meaningful behavioral characterizations [ 8]. Rather than returning a single motif, the resulting archive of high-quality motifs reveals trade-offs between motif specificity, prevalence, and structure. We evaluate three complementary de-scriptor pairings on sequences derived from human CTCF ChIP-seq data generated by the ENCODE Project[ 4], using stratified subsets to assess robustness across samples and comparisons to MEME as a widely adopted baseline [ 1 ]. Rather than proposing a replace-ment for classical motif discovery tools, this work positions quality-diversity search as an exploratory complement, enabling structured exploration of motif landscapes that are otherwise collapsed into single consensus solutions. As a companion contribution, we em-phasize illumination and interpretability over exhaustive validation. 

2 Methods 2.1 Motif Representation 

Candidate motifs are represented as fixed-length position weight matrices (PWMs) over the DNA alphabet {𝐴, 𝐶, 𝐺,𝑇 }. Each motif is a row-stochastic matrix 𝑃 ∈ R𝐿 ×4, where rows define categorical nucleotide distributions at each position, consistent with standard motif discovery practice and comparable to MEME outputs [ 1 , 13 ]. Initial motifs are sampled from a symmetric Dirichlet distribution, with 𝐿 fixed across experiments. 

2.2 Fitness Evaluation 

A PWM is evaluated by its ability to discriminate foreground se-quences from background using a log-odds scoring framework [ 13 , 14 ]. Let 𝑀 ∈ [ 0, 1]𝐿 ×4 denote a PWM of length 𝐿 , 𝑃 bg ∈ [ 0, 1]4

an empirical background nucleotide distribution, and 𝑆 a set of input sequences. For a length-𝐿 window 𝑤 = (𝑤 1, . . . , 𝑤 𝐿 ), the log-odds score is

𝑔 (𝑀, 𝑠 ) values. In our experiments, 𝑘 = ⌈0.2|𝑆 |⌉ , with a small trimmed variant (trim fraction 0.1) for robustness. 

2.3 MAP-Elites 

We use MAP-Elites as the optimization framework for motif dis-covery. The algorithm maintains an archive indexed by behavioral descriptors, where each cell stores the highest-fitness motif dis-covered for that region of descriptor space [ 8]. Candidate motifs are generated through emitter-driven stochastic variation and com-pete locally within archive cells based on fitness, while diversity is preserved globally by construction. The resulting archive enables post hoc analysis of trade-offs between motif quality, specificity, prevalence, and structural variability, facilitating richer comparison with classical single-solution motif discovery methods. 

3 Experiments 

All experiments are conducted on human CTCF ChIP-seq data aligned to the hg38 genome assembly [ 4]. Candidate motifs are represented as fixed-length PWMs of length 𝐿 = 19 , corresponding to the known length of the canonical CTCF binding motif [ 4, 9 ]. Unless otherwise stated, all algorithmic components other than the behavioral characterizations are held constant. 

3.1 Benchmark Dataset and Subset Construction 

Evaluating candidate motifs requires scanning each motif across all sequences, which is computationally expensive for larger datasets. To balance biological realism with computational tractability, the dataset is partitioned into five disjoint subsets, each containing an equal number of foreground sequences sampled from high-confidence ChIP-seq peaks. For each foreground set, a matched background set is constructed from genomic regions with similar characteristics. Both MAP-Elites and the baseline method MEME are evaluated independently on each subset. MEME is run on each subset to generate PWMs, which are then evaluated using the same likelihood-based fitness function (Equation 3) applied to MAP-Elites motifs, ensuring direct and fair comparison across methods. Subset-level evaluation enables assessment of robustness across samples drawn from the same underlying biological signal. 

3.2 Behavior Characterizations 

To isolate the effect of descriptor choice, all experiments use the same fitness function (Eq. 3), evolutionary operators, emitter con-figuration, archive resolution, and run length, while varying only the behavioral descriptors defining the MAP-Elites archive. We evaluate three complementary descriptor pairings, each designed to illuminate a distinct aspect of motif diversity: (1) Information Content and Support 

Information Content captures motif specificity relative to background frequencies, while Support measures the frac-tion of foreground sequences in which the motif appears above a calibrated threshold [ 13 ]. This pairing distinguishes rare but highly specific motifs from broader patterns. (2) GC Content and Entropy 

GC Content measures average nucleotide composition, while Entropy captures the intrinsic positional variability indepen-dent of background frequencies [ 13 ]. This pairing empha-sizes structural and compositional diversity among motifs. (3) Support and Score Tail Behavior 

This pairing combines motif prevalence with a summary of the upper tail of best-hit score distributions, distinguishing motifs that moderately explain many sequences from those that strongly explain a smaller subset. Across all experiments, only behavioral characterizations are varied. Descriptor ranges are estimated automatically by evaluating randomly generated PWMs and setting bounds to the [1% , 99% ]

quantiles over 400 samples with a 10% padding factor, avoiding man-ual tuning while ensuring biologically plausible archive discretiza-tion. For conciseness, the three descriptor pairings are denoted Motif Diversity in Human Liver ChIP-seq Data Using MAP-Elites , , 

ME.SP (Information Content and Support), ME.CO (GC Content and Entropy), and ME.RB (Support and Tail Behavior). 

3.3 Experimental Parameters 

Fitness is computed using the likelihood-based objective in Equa-tion 3. Because the score reflects relative foreground-background discrimination, fitness values may be negative, indicating weak or non-discriminative enrichment rather than invalid solutions. Support thresholds are calibrated independently for each subset using background sequences, with thresholds set at the 95th per-centile of background best-hit scores. MAP-Elites is implemented using the pyribs library with a GridArchive and an IsoLineEmitter [15 ]. Each run executes for 1,000 generations with a 20 × 20 archive, generating batches of 32 candidates per iteration using isotropic and directional perturbations ( 𝜎 iso = 0.12 , 𝜎 line = 0.25 ). Throughout each run, archive statistics including coverage, best fitness, and QD score are logged, and the full archive is retained for downstream analysis and comparison with MEME. In addition to peak fitness, these metrics characterize search dynamics and representational capacity. Archive coverage quantifies how much of the descriptor space is populated by viable motifs, while the QD score aggregates fitness across occupied cells, reflecting the ability of MAP-Elites to maintain simultaneously competitive solutions rather than converging to a single optimum.

MEME 1.11 −2.02 ± 1.03

4 Results 

Our evaluation examines how quality-diversity search recovers multiple high-quality motif hypotheses and how behavioral charac-terizations shape archive structure and discovered solutions, rather than identifying a single optimal motif. Across all behavioral char-acterizations and dataset subsets, MAP-Elites consistently achieved high archive coverage, indicating that large portions of the de-scriptor space correspond to biologically viable motifs. QD scores increased steadily and stabilized early, suggesting effective mainte-nance of multiple competitive motifs rather than convergence to a narrow region of the search space. Negative average fitness values for MEME reflect the inclusion of progressively weaker residual motifs extracted after the domi-nant solution, rather than invalid or failed outputs. This behavior highlights differences in search objectives between single-solution extraction and archive-based illumination rather than deficiencies of the baseline method.

extracts patterns from residual and increasingly heterogeneous sig-nal. This behavior is reflected in the higher variance of MEME’s average fitness across subsets. In contrast, MAP-Elites maintains a diverse population of high-quality motifs throughout the search by explicitly preserving elites across behavioral characterizations. As shown in Table 1, MAP-Elites recovers multiple motifs with fitness comparable to MEME’s strongest solutions while exhibit-ing more stable average performance across subsets. Importantly, the primary distinction between methods is not peak fitness but representational capacity: while MEME yields a single dominant hypothesis per subset, MAP-Elites exposes structured families of competitive motifs spanning distinct biological trade-offs. Figure 2 provides a qualitative comparison between motifs dis-covered by MAP-Elites and those produced by MEME. While MEME returns a single dominant motif per subset, MAP-Elites exposes multiple motif variants spanning a range of specificity and cover-age. The corresponding sequence logos reveal distinct positional preferences and degrees of degeneracy among high-fitness motifs, illustrating how illumination preserves structured alternatives that would be collapsed into a single consensus solution by optimization. 

4.2 Archive Structure and Descriptor Effects 

We analyze how MAP-Elites organizes the motif search space un-der each behavioral characterization (BC) by examining archive coverage, fitness distributions, and spatial structure. Across all BCs, MAP-Elites produces well-populated and structured archives with smooth fitness gradients, indicating that each descriptor captures a meaningful dimension of motif variation. However, the internal organization of these archives differs across descriptor choices. This reflects how descriptor selection biases which regions of the mo-tif landscape are emphasized, even when the underlying fitness function and evolutionary operators remain fixed. 

ME.SP. In the ME.SP characterization, archive fitness is strongly dominated by support, with information content acting as a sec-ondary refinement. As shown in Figure 1(a), high-fitness motifs concentrate in regions of broad support, producing a stable average archive fitness of 0.464 ± 0.010 across subsets. This pattern sug-gests that, for the CTCF data considered here, motif prevalence across sequences is a primary driver of quality under the fore-ground–background objective. , , Medina et al. 

ME.CO. ME.CO yields both the highest maximum fitness and the highest average fitness, albeit with higher variance across sub-sets (Table 1). The corresponding archive (Figure 1(b)) exhibits a pronounced fitness ridge aligned with GC-rich, low-entropy motifs, consistent with known compositional properties of CTCF binding sites. Although this BC does not explicitly encode coverage, it re-covers a compact and interpretable set of high-quality motifs that align closely with biological expectations. 

ME.RB. This characterization exposes a trade-off between cover-age and robustness. As illustrated in Figure 1(c), high-fitness motifs balance broad support with moderate score dispersion, whereas extreme tail behavior is consistently associated with lower-quality solutions. While this BC yields lower aggregate fitness than ME.SP and ME.CO, it highlights motif variants that are robust across se-quences rather than narrowly optimized for peak scores. Taken together, these results demonstrate that while MAP-Elites achieves comparable archive coverage across descriptor choices, de-scriptor selection substantially shapes archive organization, fitness distributions, and the types of motif variants emphasized. 

5 Conclusion 

In this work, we formulate DNA motif discovery as a quality-diversity problem and demonstrate that illumination-based search can recover diverse, high-quality motif hypotheses from real bio-logical sequence data. By applying MAP-Elites with biologically meaningful behavioral characterizations, we demonstrate that motif discovery can be structured around explicit trade-offs between cov-erage, compositional structure, and robustness, rather than collaps-ing these dimensions into a single optimal solution. Experiments on human CTCF ChIP-seq data indicate that MAP-Elites recovers motifs with fitness comparable to those produced by MEME, while simultaneously maintaining a diverse set of alternative motif vari-ants. The motif variants can capture variability important for the function of these sequences in difference biological contexts. These results also highlight how descriptor choice shapes not only ag-gregate performance, but also the organization and interpretability of the discovered motif space-information that is inaccessible to classical single-solution approaches. This study represents an initial step toward applying quality diversity methods to motif discovery and has some notable limita-tions. Our experiments are restricted to a single biological setting, a fixed motif length, and a single QD algorithm. We intention-ally restrict the study this way to isolate the effects of descriptor choices and archive structure using a well known QD algorithm before scaling to broader biological benchmarks. In addition, the fitness function is tailored to foreground-background discrimina-tion. Addressing these limitations by extending this framework to additional datasets, alternative QD algorithms, and alternative fit-ness functions represents a direction for future work. Overall, these preliminary results establish quality diversity as a promising frame-work for exploratory motif analysis, motivating future work that scales illumination-based approaches across transcription factors, datasets, and biological contexts.
